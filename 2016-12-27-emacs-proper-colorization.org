* Preamble
  No need to argue about meaning colors. It is, and lets try to use
  this feature by adjusting and revival Emacs' desktop view.

  A plethora of arbitrary colorization plugins already exists and
  =color-theme= is one an old-school and large library of colorization
  solutions.

* Solution

** Installation
   As trivial as it ever possible for Emacs package.

** Customizing
   It is possible to do this by extending the =init.el= file, /but/
   it cause the color corruption in result. Hence I [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html][would suggest]] to
   create =default.el= and put it somewhere in the =load-path=

   I'm allocate it at =/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp=:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     ;; all customization processed after init.el are there
     ;; colorization
     (require 'color-theme)
     (eval-after-load "color-theme"
       '(progn
          (color-theme-initialize)
          (color-theme-lawrence)
          (color-theme-euphoria)))

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c 1") 'color-theme-clarity)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c 2") 'color-theme-ld-dark)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c 3") 'color-theme-hober)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c 4") 'color-theme-oswald)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c 5") 'color-theme-tty-dark)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c 6") 'color-theme-taming-mr-arneson)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c 7") 'color-theme-euphoria)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c 8") 'color-theme-lawrence)

* Conclusion
  Now you should get a much pretty and clear view for your source code.
  Hope it would be something like this:
