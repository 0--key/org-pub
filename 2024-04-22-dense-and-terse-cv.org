* \alpha{}bout Me

I'm a vocational life-long learner apt to detangle a thousand pages
of technical documentation, technological schemes, diagrams and charts
on electronics, electrotechnics, thermomechanics, automatics,
telemetry, programming and even nuclear physics, comprehend the gist
out there and utilise these knowledge in my professional activity.

** 2003 \to 2022

Alongside with my liable duties I was being attested as an instructor:
I've shared my professional experience and knowledge about
technological niceties, subtleties and obscure caveats with my
younger colleagues (~15 of them were being fostered by me), assisted
them by an advice, cue, nudge or by a relevant quote from technical
documentation in their professional growth.

Professionally being plunged into automated measurement of radioactive
parameters: I've read zealously around 5 hundred pages of
technological documentation, a hundred sheets of schemes and diagrams,
comprehended the pith out there and was certified as a measurement
quality engineer in charge to manage technological measurements under
1,500 independent measurement channels up from an active core of
nuclear reactor to 30 km perimeter of the NPP site.

My primary liable duties was:

Control under proper and accurate functioning of automated measurement
system by:
  + Continuous monitoring values of technological parameters;
  + Detection any deviation from its normal state;
  + Periodical visual supervision and inspection of normal state of
    each its part;
  + Making log entries about the system's part state/deviation;
  + Emergency intrusion/adjustment with purpose to restore its normal
    state;
