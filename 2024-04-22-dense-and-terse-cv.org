* \alpha{}bout Me

I'm a vocational life-long learner apt to detangle a thousand pages of
technical documentation, technological schemes, diagrams and charts on
electronics, electromechanics, pneumatics, automatics, telemetry,
programming and even nuclear physics, comprehend the gist out there
and utilise these knowledge in my professional activity with aim to
ensure stable, reliable and safe work of any automatic system.

** 2003 \to 2022

Alongside with my liable duties I was being attested as an
/instructor/: I've shared my professional experience and knowledge
about technological niceties, subtleties and obscure caveats with my
younger colleagues (~15 of them were being fostered by me), assisted
them in their professional growth by a piece of advice, cue, nudge or
by a relevant quote from technical documentation.

Professionally being plunged into automated measurement of radioactive
parameters: I've read zealously around 5 hundred pages of
technological documentation, a hundred sheets of schemes and diagrams,
comprehended the pith out there and was certified as a measurement
quality engineer in charge to manage technological measurements under
1,500 independent measurement channels up from an active core of
nuclear reactor to 30 km perimeter of the NPP site.

My primary liable duties was:

Perform a control under proper, accurate and safe functioning of
automated measurement system by:
  + Continuous monitoring the values of several thousands
    technological parameters (level, pressure, temperature, specific
    radioactivity, voltage, consuming power);
  + Detection any deviation from its normal status;
  + Periodical visual supervision and inspection of normal condition
    of each its section;
  + Making log entries about the system's part status/deviation;
  + Emergency intrusion/adjustment/repair any of its segments with a
    purpose to restore its normal functioning;
