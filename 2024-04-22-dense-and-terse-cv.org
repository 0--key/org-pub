* \alpha{}bout Me

I'm a vocational life-long learner apt to detangle a thousand pages of
technical documentation, technological schemes, diagrams and charts on
electronics, electromechanics, pneumatics, automatics, telemetry,
programming and even nuclear physics, comprehend the gist out there
and utilise these knowledge in my professional activity with aim to
ensure stable, reliable and safe work of any automatic system.

** 2003 \to 2022

Alongside with my liable duties I was being attested as an
/instructor/: I've shared my professional experience and knowledge
about technological niceties, subtleties and obscure caveats with my
younger colleagues (~15 of them were being fostered by me), assisted
them in their professional growth by a piece of advice, cue, nudge or
by a relevant quote from technical documentation.

Professionally being plunged into automated measurement of radioactive
parameters: I've read zealously around 5 hundred pages of
technological documentation, a hundred sheets of schemes and diagrams,
comprehended the pith out there and was certified as a measurement
quality engineer in charge to manage technological measurements under
1,500 independent measurement channels up from an active core of
nuclear reactor to 30 km perimeter of the NPP site.

My primary liable duties was:

Perform a control under proper, accurate and safe functioning of
automated measurement system by:
  + Continuous monitoring the values of several thousands
    technological parameters (level, pressure, temperature, specific
    radioactivity, voltage, consuming power);
  + Detection any deviation from its normal status;
  + Periodical visual supervision and inspection of normal condition
    of each its section;
  + Making log entries about the system's part status/deviation;
  + Emergency intrusion/adjustment/repair any of its segments with a
    purpose to restore its normal functioning;

The duties of a maintenance engineer typically revolve around ensuring that machinery, systems, infrastructure, and equipment run optimally with minimal downtime. These responsibilities include:

1. **Conducting and overseeing maintenance process audits**[1].
2. **Diagnosing faults**[1].
3. **Undertaking planned maintenance**[1].
4. **Establishing different maintenance procedures and protocols**[1].
5. **Training staff on equipment operating and maintenance procedures**[1].
6. **Responding to major equipment breakdowns**[1].
7. **Forecasting and strategic planning for system overhauls and upgrades, while taking into account long-term maintenance costs**[1].
8. **Supervising other engineering and technical staff**[1].
9. **Procuring, testing, and commissioning specialist components, fixtures, or fittings**[1].
10. **Working with the maintenance director and other executives to manage budgets**[1].
11. **Setting and tracking maintenance KPIs**[1].
12. **Playing an active role in helping the organization set up and execute preventive maintenance, predictive maintenance, or any other preferred maintenance program**[1].

Additionally, maintenance engineers may also be involved in:

1. **Designing maintenance strategies, procedures, and methods**[2].
2. **Carrying out routine maintenance work and responding to equipment faults**[2].
3. **Fitting new parts and ensuring equipment is working correctly**[2].
4. **Carrying out quality inspections on jobs**[2].
5. **Liaising with client departments, customers, and other engineering and production colleagues**[2].
6. **Arranging specialist procurement of fixtures, fittings, or components**[2].
7. **Controlling maintenance tools, stores, and equipment**[2].
8. **Monitoring and controlling maintenance costs**[2].
9. **Dealing with emergencies, unplanned problems, and repairs**[2].
10. **Improving health and safety policies and procedures**[2].
11. **Working with specialist equipment, such as programmable logic controllers (PLC), which control machinery on factory assembly lines**[2].
12. **Writing maintenance strategies to help with installation and commissioning guidelines**[2].
13. **Ensuring there is continuous cover of the machinery and equipment in case of breakdowns**[2].

Maintenance engineers work in a variety of environments, including industrial settings, and their duties can vary depending on the company and the specific role. However, their primary goal is to ensure that equipment and machinery run smoothly and reliably, and that maintenance is carried out efficiently and effectively[1][2][3][4][5].
