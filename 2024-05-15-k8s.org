* Overview

Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate the
deployment, scaling, and operation of /containerized
applications/. Originally developed by Google and now maintained by
the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Kubernetes helps manage
clusters of compute instances, ensuring that containerized
applications run consistently in different environments.

#+begin_quote
Kubernetes provides a robust framework to run distributed systems
resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your
application, provides deployment patterns, and more, making it easier
to manage complex applications consistently across various
environments.

Here are some key concepts and features of Kubernetes:

** Glossary:

*** Containers:
These are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include
everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code,
runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

*** Pods:
The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, which can contain /one or
more containers/. Pods represent a single instance of a running
process in a cluster.

*** Nodes:
/Worker nodes/ run the containers and are managed by the control
plane. Each node contains the necessary services to run pods,
including the container runtime, kubelet, and kube-proxy.

*** Clusters:
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a /set/ of worker machines, called
nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least
one worker node.


*** Control Plane:
The control plane manages the Kubernetes cluster. It makes decisions
about the cluster (like scheduling), detects and responds to cluster
events, and manages the cluster’s lifecycle.

*** Key Components of the Control Plane:
- Kube-APIserver: Exposes the Kubernetes API and is the entry
  point for all the administrative tasks.
- etcd: A consistent and highly-available key-value store used as
  Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
- Kube-scheduler: Assigns workloads to specific nodes based on several
  factors like resource requirements.
- Kube-controller-manager: Runs various controllers to manage the
  state of the cluster.

** Main features:

*** Service Discovery and Load Balancing:
Kubernetes can expose a container using a DNS name or its IP
address. It can also load balance the traffic to containers to ensure
consistent application performance.

*** Storage Orchestration:
Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount the storage system of
your choice, such as local storage, public cloud providers, and more.

*** Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks:
Kubernetes can manage the deployment of application changes, allowing
for controlled rollouts and automatic rollbacks if something goes
wrong.

*** Self-Healing:
Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules
containers when nodes die, kills containers that don't respond to
user-defined health checks, and doesn't advertise them to clients
until they are ready to serve.

*** Secret and Configuration Management:
Kubernetes provides a way to manage sensitive information, such as
passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys. You can deploy and update
secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your image
and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration.

* Installation & initial configuration

Deploying a Kubernetes cluster on Debian 12 involves several
steps. You'll need to prepare your environment, install the necessary
components, and configure your cluster. Here's a step-by-step guide:

** Prepare the Environment

1. **Update the system**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
   ```

3. **Disable swap** (Kubernetes requires swap to be disabled):
   ```bash
   sudo swapoff -a
   sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^/#/' /etc/fstab
   ```

4. **Load necessary kernel modules**:
   ```bash
   sudo modprobe overlay
   sudo modprobe br_netfilter
   ```

5. **Add required sysctl settings**:
   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/kubernetes.conf
   net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
   net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
   net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
   EOF
   sudo sysctl --system
   ```

** Install Container Runtime (Docker)

1. **Add Docker’s official GPG key**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```

2. **Set up the Docker repository**:
   ```bash
   echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   ```

3. **Install Docker**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```

4. **Configure Docker daemon**:
   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
   {
     "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
     "log-driver": "json-file",
     "log-opts": {
       "max-size": "100m"
     },
     "storage-driver": "overlay2"
   }
   EOF
   ```

5. **Restart Docker**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

### Step 3: Install Kubernetes Components

1. **Add Kubernetes’ official GPG key**:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

2. **Add the Kubernetes repository**:
   ```bash
   echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
   ```

3. **Install kubelet, kubeadm, and kubectl**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
   sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
   ```

### Step 4: Initialize the Kubernetes Master Node

1. **Initialize the master node** (replace `<YOUR-ADVERTISE-ADDRESS>` with your actual IP address):
   ```bash
   sudo kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address=<YOUR-ADVERTISE-ADDRESS> --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
   ```

2. **Set up local kubeconfig**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
   sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
   sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
   ```

### Step 5: Install a Pod Network

1. **Install Flannel** (a popular network add-on):
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
   ```

### Step 6: Join Worker Nodes

1. **On each worker node, run the command generated by `kubeadm init` on the master node**. It will look something like this:
   ```bash
   sudo kubeadm join <MASTER-IP>:6443 --token <TOKEN> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<HASH>
   ```

2. **Verify the cluster nodes**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

### Conclusion By following these steps, you will have set up a basic
Kubernetes cluster on Debian 12. This setup includes one master node
and multiple worker nodes. For a production environment, consider
additional configurations for security, high availability, and
persistent storage.
