* \alpha Brief introduction
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Synergy \to the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations,
  substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than
  the sum of their separate effects
  #+END_QUOTE
  I'm an avid knowledge gatherer as soon as I remember myself.
  Generally speaking the acts speak much louder than words, thus, to
  avoid the idle hand-waving (typing in this case, of cause), this is
  the most prominent and distinct properties of myself:
  - Coursera certificates:
    + Learning to Learn
    + Model Thinking
    + Introduction in Data Science
  - My accounts on:
    - Git
    - StackOverflow
    - UpWork
    - LinkedIn
  - Org-Jekyll blog

* \beta Skills overview
  
** Emacs and a plethora of satellite packages

** Python cooked gently in Emacs:
   - Built-in functions test suite
   - Cookbook in a TDD dissection
   - OOP design patterns scrutiny


* \gamma Current state
  Following the concept of /knowledge chain reaction/\trade I'm in conveying
  my own skills to my family: my patient, wise&cute wife and to my
  astute sonny. 

* \Delta Desired role
  - A team catalyst, accelerator and propeller. Who next will fall in
    love with Emacs and Python simultaneously?
  - Synergy in the team is not just only a sum of knowledge, our goal
    is to obtain its product literally: *\sum knowledge_{i} \to \prod knowledge_{i}*
  - Right now for professional growth I'm crucially need in /knowledge
    exchange/: who knows something fascinating and would share it with
    me, please?

** Who am I
   First of all I'm happy father and husband. The second one is my
   innate hyper-curiousity. In most cases I've succeeded on this by my
   solid patience and immutable humor sense. 

   And the third and last about me:

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   There are rules in our Universe and all stuff around us strictly
   follows these rules. The Gravity, Electricity and Nuclear Reactions
   are kings and queens in their realm and our world simultaneously.   
   #+END_QUOTE
   
   *Happy grows in the mind*

** What I do

   I'm a data-driven person. Unconsciously I'm trying to know much
   details about my personal environment. It's just my innate
   hyper-curiosity. It forces me, it inspires me, it is my passion,
   hobby and my live-style.

   Thus: *data, data, data*

** What I fun for

   In the secondary school I've noticed that machines are much
   stronger than people. The short introduction about how difficult is
   to enslave the iron helpers I got when I learned car-driving
   method. It was awesome.

   But there are long time gone, and now I focused on /programming/
   machines to do large amount of job on incredible speed. It's
   partially a science, but on another side it might be a sport in the
   same time.

   Hence: *machines, speed, programming*

** Beginning
   I started to write programs in 1992 for scientific calculator MK-61.
   It was 104 directives sequence but it was in charge to calculate 100!
   in a couple hours. And even the Moon landing simulator was there.
   Soon I assembled a graphical cluster of memory ZX Spectrum.

 Key achievements: ;
 i486 was extraordinary fast and I met initially Borland’s dBase; In
 1995 fall I started to studying Data Science and Automation Technology
 in the naval college classes; In 2000 I found there are no support for
 OS Windows in my country; In 2005 I bought Athlon i686 and installed
 Red Hat Linux on it. It caused a seismic shift in my mind. Open Source
 works(!); By sequential studying bash, HTML, CSS, Emacs, Python2,
 MySQL and BigTable in 2008 I deployed my first web application on
 Google App Engine. And jQuery was there also; In 2009 I started to
 work as a freelancer at oDesk with Scrapy 0.10 In 2012 I dissected
 PostgreSQL, Amazon Web Services and started to utilize their power and
 flexibility; 2013 NoSQL was discovered. It’s just an unstructured
 storage ;-) 2014 I’ve upgrade my skill-set by Coursera’s MOOCs:
 Learning to Learn Model Thinking 2015 Quora reading and deep thinking
 about everything. 2016 : Python3 treatment and migration Git with
 Magit functional access essential training OOP design principles
 scrutiny TDD concepts and approaches study Literate programming with
 Emacs Babel Blogging with Jekyll Quora reading as natural English
 source Computer algorithms studying Coding skills honing with CodeWars
 Tutoring and conveying these skills to my wife

 Employment:

 2009 – 2016 freelance full stack Python web application developer

 Personal skills:

 capable to learn joyfully and fast persistence and patience

 Personal: reading-addicted
