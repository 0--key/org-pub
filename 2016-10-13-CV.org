* \Alpha{}bout me

 I'm a voracious reader and avid knowledge gatherer as long as I can
 remember myself. Initially it was just fun, a bit later I commenced a
 conscious approach to learning and found an urge necessity for
 meta-learning: skill that allows to study any subject much effective.

 After acquisition of these skill, when I've [[http://bit.ly/2nPfOXR][learnt how to learn]],
 naturally loomed the next challenge:

 #+begin_quote
  What should I know to be healthy, wealthy and wise?
  #+end_quote

 Soon it became clear to me /I should know everything/ for that and it
 is just impossible due to /infinite amount of knowledge/. So I need
 to find a trade off, a some hack which allows me /to be happy enough/
 to live and prosper. And I choose to study =Computer Science= that by
 definition ought to amplify my ability to sift, put it in order and
 consume information. And, as an inevitable catalyser, [[http://bit.ly/1lk9C7p][model thinking]]
 was a right tool in the hands. Furthermore these skills will liverage
 my capability to acquire the knowledge much faster.

 Further, pondering in this direction pointed me out =Python= as the
 main tool to cope with a plethora of *Data*, =Emacs= as the handy
 tool to cope with =Python=, =Bash=, myself and computer in the same
 time. A mammoth task was to find a cue to myself, elaborate the right
 system in learning, other required only time and patience.

 Several years I've spent studying these mighty tools, from time to
 time practicing in applied areas, making pauses for contemplation,
 and now I'm proud that I'm in charge to solve most of feasible tasks.

 
* \Beta{}rief overview

* \Gamma{}ist

* \Delta{}esired role

  - A team catalyst, accelerator and propeller. Who next will fall in
    love with Emacs and Python simultaneously?
  - A synergy among the team is not just only a sum of knowledge, our
    goal is to obtain its product literally:
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{team}\sum_{k=1}^{skill}\to\prod_{n=1}^{team}\sum_{k=1}^{skill}$
    #+END_QUOTE
  - In other words the desired aim should be a /knowledge
    multiplication/: sustainable state of continuous intellectual
    advancements for each collaborator in particular.
  - A team of professionals with mostly contiguous skills.
  - Right now for professional growth I'm crucially need in /knowledge
    exchange/: who knows something fascinating and would share it with
    me, please?

  The acts speak much louder than words, thus, this
  is the very gist out of my professional skills: [[http://bit.ly/2nPfOXR][Leaning to Learn]],
  [[http://bit.ly/2nSSGJQ][Introduction to Data Science]], [[http://bit.ly/1lk9C7p][Model
  Thinking]], [[http://bit.ly/2nP3uqx][Ovivo]], Pythonanywhere, 0--key, [[http://bit.ly/211LI1k][oDesk]], FastFresh,
  Py-Org-Cookbook, Perceptron in OOP Python3, Python Design Patterns
  Catalogue, StackOverflow.

  In 2017 I've begun to dissect an Artificial Intelligent approach for
  data classification, Elisp, NumPy, SciPy, GNU Octave and enrolled
  into [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks/home][Neural Networks for Machine Learning]].
 
* \mu{}otto

  Synergy \to the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations,
  substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than
  the sum of their separate effects:

  $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{team}\sum_{k=1}^{skill}\Rightarrow\prod_{n=1}^{team}\sum_{k=1}^{skill}$





* Patches
  contrarian, a snap judgment about real power of machines, owing to
  my innate curiosity and perseverance, I've brooded about lack of
  skills that restrained, damp down the rush around these points, To
  avert the brain withering, to enshrine the versatile skills in one
  place, to choose an eligible approach to disclose the topic in a
  much attractive and explicit manner, austerely overview the
  customary of writing books about programming languages it might be
  sufficient to found its basement, suppose it is at whole a slightly
  primitive novel in English which thoroughly endeavor to shed the
  light on another language niceties.

  Emerging unit testing in the early 2000 produced a sismic shift in
  software development, but still be totally ignored by the writers.

  In these circumstances the inset test suites should serve a
  lucrative role in learning: they just vividly illustrate the core
  features in a functional dissection, sufficiently aleviate a
  headache and pain, facilitating fast and easy comprehension what is
  all this stuff purpose.

  In any case the author is entangled among only two languages: the
  programming one and a straight English.

  The core idea is to grant to the reader chance to swoop up the gist
  from the text.

  Let's take an attempt to judge that approach to a nicetiy.

** Who am I
   First of all I'm happy father and husband. The second one is my
   innate hyper-curiousity. In most cases I've succeeded on this by my
   solid patience and immutable humor sense. 

   And the third and last about me:

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   There are rules in our Universe and all stuff around us strictly
   follows these rules. The Gravity, Electricity and Nuclear Reactions
   are kings and queens in their realm and our world simultaneously.   
   #+END_QUOTE
   
   *Happy grows in the mind*

** What I do

   I'm a data-driven person. Unconsciously I'm trying to know much
   details about my personal environment. It's just my innate
   hyper-curiosity. It forces me, it inspires me, it is my passion,
   hobby and my live-style.

   Thus: *data, data, data*

** What I fun for

   In the secondary school I've noticed that machines are much
   stronger than people. The short introduction about how difficult is
   to enslave the iron helpers I got when I learned car-driving
   method. It was awesome.

   But there are long time gone, and now I focused on /programming/
   machines to do large amount of job on incredible speed. It's
   partially a science, but on another side it might be a sport in the
   same time.

   Hence: *machines, speed, programming*

** Beginning
   I started to write programs in 1992 for scientific calculator MK-61.
   It was 104 directives sequence but it was in charge to calculate 100!
   in a couple hours. And even the Moon landing simulator was there.
   Soon I assembled a graphical cluster of memory ZX Spectrum.

 Key achievements: ;
 i486 was extraordinary fast and I met initially Borland’s dBase; In
 1995 fall I started to studying Data Science and Automation Technology
 in the naval college classes; In 2000 I found there are no support for
 OS Windows in my country; In 2005 I bought Athlon i686 and installed
 Red Hat Linux on it. It caused a seismic shift in my mind. Open Source
 works(!); By sequential studying bash, HTML, CSS, Emacs, Python2,
 MySQL and BigTable in 2008 I deployed my first web application on
 Google App Engine. And jQuery was there also; In 2009 I started to
 work as a freelancer at oDesk with Scrapy 0.10 In 2012 I dissected
 PostgreSQL, Amazon Web Services and started to utilize their power and
 flexibility; 2013 NoSQL was discovered. It’s just an unstructured
 storage ;-) 2014 I’ve upgrade my skill-set by Coursera’s MOOCs:
 Learning to Learn Model Thinking 2015 Quora reading and deep thinking
 about everything. 2016 : Python3 treatment and migration Git with
 Magit functional access essential training OOP design principles
 scrutiny TDD concepts and approaches study Literate programming with
 Emacs Babel Blogging with Jekyll Quora reading as natural English
 source Computer algorithms studying Coding skills honing with CodeWars
 Tutoring and conveying these skills to my wife

 Employment:

 2009 – 2016 freelance full stack Python web application developer

 Personal skills:

 capable to learn joyfully and fast persistence and patience

 Personal: reading-addicted
