* Preamble

Attempting to describe all the dialects of English spoken in Ireland
is destined to be incomplete due to the rich and diverse linguistic
landscape. This article focuses solely on highlighting the general
discrepancies and unique features that set Hiberno-English dialects
apart.

It is important to note that Ireland's dialects are multifaceted,
influenced by historical, regional, and cultural factors that shape
the way English is spoken across the island. The features discussed
here provide a broad overview, offering insight into the distinct
characteristics of English as it is spoken in Ireland, but they cannot
capture the full complexity and nuance found in individual
dialects. Further exploration and study of specific regions may reveal
even more variety within this fascinating branch of the English
language.

* Definitions

** Modern Standard English:

This term generally refers to the standard form of the English
language used in formal writing and speaking across English-speaking
countries. It encompasses grammar, vocabulary, and sometimes
pronunciation.

** Received Pronunciation (=RP=):

=RP= is a specific accent of English /traditionally associated with
educated speakers/ in southern England. It is often considered one of
the standard accents of British English.

*RP is a pronunciation standard*, _not a broader language standard
like Modern Standard English_.

** Differences:

While =RP= can be used as a model for Modern Standard English
pronunciation, it's important to note that =RP= is only one specific
accent within the broader scope of Standard English. Modern Standard
English refers to language norms, including structure and usage,
whereas =RP= specifically refers to an accent.

In summary, while =RP= may be used as a pronunciation model within
Modern Standard English, it is not correct to equate the two terms
directly, as one refers to an accent and the other to a set of
language standards.


* Origin of the Name =Hiberno-English=

The term *Hiberno-English* originates from the Latin word =Hibernia=,
which is the classical Latin name for Ireland. The prefix "Hiberno-"
is used to denote anything related to Ireland.

** =Hibernia=: 

This was the name used by the Romans to refer to the island of
Ireland. Despite the Romans never conquering Ireland, the name
remained in use in various forms, especially in scholarly and
historical contexts.

Thus, *Hiberno-English* refers to the varieties of English spoken in
Ireland, highlighting the distinct characteristics and influences
specific to Irish English dialects.


* Origin of =Hiberno-English= Dialects

** Early English Influence:

The earliest English influence on Ireland began with the Anglo-Norman
invasion in the 12th century. However, significant English-speaking
settlements didn't form until the Tudor conquest and subsequent
Plantations in the 16th and 17th centuries.

** Irish Language Substrate:

The native Irish language (Gaeilge) has had a profound influence on
Hiberno-English. This includes syntactic, lexical, and phonetic
influences, creating distinctive features in the dialects.

** Scottish Influence:

In Ulster, particularly due to the Ulster Plantation, there was a
considerable Scottish influence, contributing to the development of
Ulster Scots language, which further influenced the local variety of
English.

** Colonial and Post-Colonial Developments:

With the Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801 and the later wave
of immigration and trade, English became the dominant language. This
period solidified English as the primary language, but it continued to
evolve with a distinctly Irish identity.

** Socioeconomic Factors:

Over time, various socioeconomic changes, including the Famine and
mass emigration, have shaped the language landscape, preserving
distinct features and introducing new ones from contact with English
speakers abroad.

** Modern Linguistic Evolution:

Today, Hiberno-English dialects continue to evolve, influenced by
global media, technology, and interaction with other English-speaking
regions, while retaining specific traditional features.

** Sum Them Up:

Each of these historical and cultural layers has contributed to the
unique characteristics of Hiberno-English dialects as we know them
today.


* The =Received Pronunciation= Phonemical Hallmarks

These phonemes below are particularly distinctive in English and can
pose challenges for speakers of other languages when learning English
pronunciation.


**  =/θ/=: The voiceless dental fricative, as in the word "think."
**  =/ð/=: The voiced dental fricative, as in the word "this."
**  =/ɹ/=: The post-alveolar approximant, as in the word "red."
**  =/æ/=: The near-open front unrounded vowel, as in the word "cat."
**  =/ʌ/=: The open-mid back unrounded vowel, as in the word "cup."
**  =/ŋ/=: The voiced velar nasal, as in the word "sing."



* The Question#1

#+begin_quote
How are these phonemes represented in Hiberno-English dialects?
#+end_quote

* Representation of Phonemes in Hiberno-English Dialects


Overall, while there are notable variations in pronunciation across
different regions and speakers within Ireland, these are some general
tendencies observed in Hiberno-English dialects.

** =/θ/= and =/ð/=:

In many Hiberno-English dialects, particularly in Dublin and
surrounding areas, the phonemes =/θ/= and =/ð/= are often pronounced
as =/t/= and =/d/= respectively.

*For example:*

     - "think" may be pronounced more like "tink."
     - "this" may be pronounced more like "dis."

** =/ɹ/=:

Hiberno-English is typically rhotic, meaning the =/ɹ/= sound is
pronounced quite clearly in most environments. However, the quality of
the =/ɹ/= may vary, sometimes being more guttural or retroflex.

** =/æ/=:

The =/æ/= vowel may be realized as a slightly higher and fronter vowel
in some parts of Ireland, often closer to =/a/= or even =/ɛa/=.

*For instance*, "cat" may sound closer to "cot" in certain areas.

** =/ʌ/=:
The =/ʌ/= vowel can sometimes be pronounced as a more central or
fronted vowel, sometimes sounding like =/ʊ/=.

*As a result*, "cup" may sound closer to "cup" with a more rounded
vowel, similar to "cook."

** =/ŋ/=:
This phoneme is generally pronounced similarly to Standard English,
but in informal settings, especially in rural areas, it might be
pronounced as =/n/= in some contexts.

*For example*, "singing" might be heard as "singin'."


* The Question#2

#+begin_quote
*Question*: What are the distinctive phonemes that unique for
Hiberno-English dialects and absent in =RP=?
#+end_quote

* Distinctive Phonemes in Hiberno-English Dialects

** =/eː/=:

In Hiberno-English, especially in the Western dialects, the vowel
sound in words like "face" and "make" can be pronounced with a long
monophthong =/eː/= rather than a diphthong =/eɪ/= as in =RP=.

** =/oː/=:

Similarly, words with the "goat" vowel, like "boat" or "note," might
feature a long monophthong =/oː/= instead of the diphthong =/oʊ/= used
in =RP=.

** =/iː/= (shortened variants):

The vowel sounds in words like "kit" and "bid" can sometimes be
pronounced with a closer vowel, resembling a shortened version of
=/iː/=, making "kit" sound almost like "keet."

** =/aɪ/=:

In some Hiberno-English dialects, particularly in the west, the
diphthong in words like "buy" and "fly" may be realized as a
monophthong =/aː/= or a more traditional diphthong =/aɪ/= pronounced
with more emphasis on the onset.

** Word-initial /h/ Dropping:

In Hiberno-English, especially in certain rural accents, you may
encounter the dropping of the word-initial /h/ sound. For example,
"house" might be pronounced as "ouse."

** *Summing it up*:

These features highlight the rich phonetic diversity within the
Hiberno-English dialects and demonstrate how these phonemes can
provide a distinct Irish flair to the spoken language that isn't
typically found in =RP=.



* The Question#3

#+begin_quote
What are *other differences* in pronunciation between Hiberno-English
and =RP=?
#+end_quote

* Differences in Pronunciation: Hiberno-English vs. RP

** Rhoticity:

Hiberno-English is typically rhotic, meaning the 'r' sound is
pronounced at the end of words and before consonants, unlike some
non-rhotic =RP= accents (e.g. Received Pronunciation).

** Vowel Length:

Longer vowel sounds in Hiberno-English, such as the realization of a
longer =/eː/= and =/oː/=, where =RP= often uses diphthongs.

** T-Flapping:

In Hiberno-English, the /t/ sound is often articulated clearly, unlike
in American English, where it might be flapped or pronounced as a soft
'd' sound.

** Intonation Patterns:

Irish English often employs a distinctive rising intonation at the end
of sentences, even in statements, which can be different from the
falling intonation typically used in =RP=.

** Vowel Harmony:

Hiberno-English features vowel harmony in some areas, where the
quality of vowels within a word can be influenced by the initial vowel
sound.

** Diphthongization:

Some monophthongs in =RP= may be diphthongized in Hiberno-English, and
vice versa. For example, the word "thought" might have a more
pronounced monophthong.

** Consonantal Differences:

There is often less assimilation of sounds in Hiberno-English. For
example, "handbag" might have clearer pronunciation of the 'd', unlike
some =RP= accents where it may assimilate to "hambag."

** Plosive Clarity:

Plosive sounds such as /p/, /t/, and /k/ are often pronounced with
more force in Hiberno-English, lacking the aspirated quality often
found in some =RP= accents.



* Conclusion

These differences contribute to the distinct identity of
Hiberno-English, offering unique sounds and speech patterns that
distinguish it from =RP=.
