* A Writing Is a Useful Habit (30 minutes)

Overall, writing is a /comprehensive activity/ that supports multiple
aspects of language learning, making it a valuable tool in the
acquisition of a foreign language. Writing is an effective method for
learning a foreign language for several reasons:

** Enhances Vocabulary and Grammar

Writing requires the active use of vocabulary and grammar rules,
reinforcing understanding and retention as learners construct
sentences and express ideas.

** Improves Memory Retention

The process of writing engages cognitive processes that improve memory
retention, as organizing thoughts and selecting appropriate words help
solidify language structures in the mind.

** Encourages Creative Thinking

Writing allows learners to be creative with the language,
experimenting with different expressions and structures, which can
deepen their understanding and fluency.

** Offers Opportunities for Practice

Regular writing practice
provides continuous opportunities to apply what has been learned,
helping to internalize new vocabulary and structures.

** Identifies Areas for Improvement

Through writing, learners can identify gaps in their knowledge and
areas that require more focus, allowing for targeted study and
correction.

** Builds Confidence

As learners become more proficient in writing, they often gain
confidence in their language skills, which can translate to improved
speaking and comprehension abilities.

** Facilitates Feedback

Writing can be easily reviewed by peers or instructors, providing
valuable feedback that can guide further learning and development.

* Reading Aloud&Translation (20 minutes)

The proverb "Slow and steady wins the race" originates from
the classic fable "The Tortoise and the Hare," attributed to
Aesop. Here is a summary of the fable:

-----
#+begin_quote
Once upon a time, a swift hare boastfully challenged a tortoise to a
race, certain of his own speed and superiority. The tortoise accepted
the challenge calmly.

On the day of the race, the two set off together. The hare sprinted
ahead quickly, confident of an easy victory. Knowing he was far ahead,
the hare decided to take a nap midway through the race, thinking he
had plenty of time to catch up later.

Meanwhile, the tortoise maintained a slow but steady pace, never
stopping to rest. As the hare slept, the tortoise continued to move
forward consistently.

When the hare finally awoke, he was startled to see the tortoise near
the finish line. Despite his frantic, speedy dash to the end, it was
too late. The tortoise crossed the finish line first, winning the
race.

The moral of the story is that perseverance and consistent effort,
even when slow, can lead to success, while overconfidence and
carelessness can result in failure.
