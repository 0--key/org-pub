* Preamble
  In many cases it might be extremely convenient to pass some particular
  code snippet (function, class or even entire file content) to Python
  shell and Elpy [[https://elpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ide.html#command-elpy-shell-send-region-or-buffer][allows]] you to do this out from the box. *But* python-mode
  [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IndentingPython][configured by default]] to use _mixed_ TAB and SPACE indentation and if you're
  trying send region you're got this error:
  ~TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation~
* Solution
  Just try to customize =indent-tabs-mode= and set it up to =nil=
  It's possible by:
  =C-h v indent-tabs-mode=
* Conclusion
  After that customization feel free to mark the region which you want to
  dissect in the python shell and pass it there by typing =C-c C-c=
