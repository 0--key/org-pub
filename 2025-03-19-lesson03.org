Check the grammar, clarify and enhance this passage:

``` I want to make the syllabus for 2-hour English lesson for adult
learners whith these sections:

- Greeting 15 minutes;
- Warming up (tongue twisters) 20 minute;
- Reading aloud 30 minutes (poetry, prosody);
- Translation 30 minutes (Aesop fables);
- Setting up and configuring Firefox 20 minutes.


Can you suggest something else?
```

#+begin_src markdown
Certainly! Creating a balanced syllabus is important to engage adult learners effectively. Here’s a revised 2-hour English lesson plan, incorporating your sections but adjusted for time and flow:

** English Lesson Plan for Adult Learners (2 hours)

*** 1. Greeting (10 minutes)
   - Welcome and introductions.
   - Short ice-breaker question (e.g., "What did you find interesting this week?").



      



*** 6. Closing Activity - Reflect and Share (10 minutes)
   - Quick recap of the lesson.
   - Share what was learned or what they found challenging.
   - Set a small related activity for the next lesson (e.g., find a new tongue twister).

This structure balances different skills like speaking, listening,
reading, and technical task management, providing a varied and
engaging learning experience.  #+end_src

* Reading Aloud (Poetry and Prosody) (25 minutes)

#+begin_quote
In the context of language and linguistics, =prosody= refers to the
patterns of rhythm, stress, and intonation in spoken language. It
encompasses several elements:

- =Rhythm:= The flow and timing of speech, including the duration of
  syllables and pauses.
- =Stress:= The emphasis placed on certain syllables or words, which
  can affect meaning and contribute to the natural rhythm of speech.
- =Intonation:= The variation in pitch while speaking, which can
  convey different meanings, emotions, or questions.

Prosody is important for understanding the nuances of language, as it
can affect the emotional tone and clarity of the spoken message.

#+begin_verse
Every night and every morn
Some to misery are born.
Every morn and every night
Some are born to sweet delight.
Some are born to sweet delight,
Some are born to endless night.

#+begin_verse
Tyger Tyger, burning bright, 
In the forests of the night; 
What immortal hand or eye, 
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies. 
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand, dare seize the fire?

And what shoulder, & what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat.
What dread hand? & what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain,
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp.
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

When the stars threw down their spears 
And water'd heaven with their tears:
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Tyger Tyger burning bright,
In the forests of the night:
What immortal hand or eye,
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
#+end_verse


* Translation - Fables (30 minutes)

Here is a popular anecdote that illustrates the value of
sharing and cooperation, often told about an American farmer who
shares his corn seeds:

#+begin_quote
A successful corn farmer in the Midwest consistently won the annual
best corn competition at the state fair. Intrigued by his success, a
reporter interviewed him and discovered an unexpected strategy: the
farmer shared his best seeds with his neighbors.

Puzzled, the reporter asked why he would share his prize-winning seeds
with competitors. The farmer explained that wind picks up pollen from
the ripening corn and swirls it from field to field. If his neighbors
grew inferior corn, cross-pollination would degrade the quality of his
own crop. By ensuring his neighbors had top-quality seeds as well, he
maintained /the excellence of his own/ corn.
#+end_quote

This story highlights the interconnectedness of communities and how
cooperation can lead to collective success, illustrating the principle
that one's well-being is tied to the well-being of others.
