* Meta-learning in the Context

=Meta-learning= refers to the process of understanding /how one
learns/ and acquires new knowledge. /In the context of adult
education/, it emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and
self-regulation in learning strategies. Adults can benefit from
=meta-learning= by identifying their preferred /learning styles/ and
/adapting their methods/ to enhance comprehension and retention. This
approach not only promotes more effective learning but also fosters
greater independence and confidence in navigating complex information.

*Definition*:

=Meta-learning=, often referred to as /"learning how to
learn,"/ involves understanding and managing one's own learning
processes. This encompasses a range of skills, attitudes, and
strategies that empower adults to take control of their learning
experiences.
