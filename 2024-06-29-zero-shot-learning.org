*Zero-shot* learning is a concept in machine learning and natural
language processing where a model is trained to recognize or classify
data it has /never seen before/. The underlying goal is to enable the
model to generalize knowledge learned from seen classes to unseen
classes by leveraging auxiliary information, such as semantic
attributes or descriptions.


In other words, *zero-shot* learning aims to enable a model to
recognize and classify data it hasn't encountered during
training. This is achieved by using /auxiliary information/, such as
semantic attributes or descriptions, to /bridge the gap between known
and unknown classes/. By leveraging this additional context, the model
can generalize its learning to accurately identify unseen classes.

*In essence*, zero-shot learning ensures that a model can understand
new categories without direct prior exposure.


* Key Components and Concepts:                                     :noexport:

  1. **Generalization:** Zero-shot learning hinges on a model's ability
     to generalize from known classes to unknown classes. This contrasts
     with traditional supervised learning, where models can only
     classify data from categories seen during training.

  2. **Auxiliary Information:** To facilitate this generalization,
     zero-shot learning often relies on additional information like
     semantic descriptors, word embeddings, or attributes that provide
     more context about the unseen classes. For example, descriptions of
     attributes (e.g., shape, color, size) or relationships (e.g., "a
     zebra is like a horse but with stripes") can be used.

  3. **Embedding Spaces:** Techniques like word embeddings (e.g.,
     Word2Vec, GloVe) or other kinds of vector space representations are
     often utilized to create a shared semantic space. In such a space,
     the relationships between different concepts can be captured
     geometrically. During inference, the input data is mapped into this
     semantic space and matched against the description or attributes of
     the unseen classes.

  4. **Applications:**
     - **Image Classification:** Recognizing objects or species not seen
       during training using visual attributes or descriptions.
     - **Natural Language Processing:** Understanding and generating
       text about concepts not seen during training by leveraging word
       embeddings or ontologies.
     - **Recommendation Systems:** Suggesting items that haven't been
       explicitly rated by users but described in reviews or texts
       associated with other items.

* Example in Image Recognition:                                    :noexport:

  Imagine you have a model trained on images of several types of
  animals, such as cats, dogs, and horses. You want your model also to
  recognize zebras, even though it has never seen an image of a
  zebra. Here's how it works in zero-shot learning:

  1. **Attribute Description:** Describe zebras using attributes like
     "has stripes," "four-legged," "herbivore," and "similar to a
     horse."
  2. **Semantic Embedding:** Create an embedding space where these
     attributes and the visual features of known animals (cat, dog,
     horse) are represented.
  3. **Mapping:** When the model evaluates an unseen zebra image, it
     maps the image features into the embedding space.
  4. **Inference:** The model searches for the closest match among the
     described attributes in the embedding space and identifies it as a
     zebra based on the similarity.

* Benefits:                                                        :noexport:

  - **Scalability:** Can handle a vast number of categories without
    requiring labeled data for each.
  - **Efficiency:** Reduces the need for extensive labeled datasets for
    every new class.
  - **Flexibility:** Easily extended to various applications, from image
    and text recognition to recommendation systems.

* Challenges:                                                      :noexport:

  - **Accuracy:** Achieving high accuracy with unseen classes can be
    challenging.
  - **Quality of Auxiliary Information:** The performance heavily
    depends on the richness and quality of the semantic attributes or
    descriptions used.
  - **Complexity:** Requires sophisticated models and often more complex
    training processes.

* Non-empirical system of perception                               :noexport:

Seems like zero-shot learning have a relation with non-empirical
system of perception. Can you discribe it, please?

#+begin_src markdown
  Zero-shot learning and non-empirical systems of perception can indeed
  share some conceptual similarities, although they originate from
  different domainsâ€”zero-shot learning in machine learning and
  non-empirical perception in philosophy or cognitive science.

  ### Zero-Shot Learning:
  - **Definition:** In machine learning, zero-shot learning refers to
    the model's ability to recognize and classify instances that it has
    never seen during training. This is achieved by leveraging auxiliary
    information like semantic attributes or descriptions that provide
    context about the unseen classes.
  - **Mechanism:** The model uses generalization from known classes to
    make inferences about new, unseen classes based on available
    relational or descriptive data.

  ### Non-Empirical Systems of Perception:
  - **Definition:** Non-empirical perception refers to forms of
    understanding or insight that are not based directly on empirical,
    sensory experience or direct observation. This can involve abstract
    thinking, intuition, or innate understanding.
  - **Characteristics:** Such systems may involve reasoning,
    imagination, conceptual understanding, or mental constructs that
    allow individuals to interpret inputs beyond immediate sensory data.

  ### Connection and Relation:
  1. **Generalization Beyond Immediate Experience:**
     - Both zero-shot learning and non-empirical perception involve
       making inferences or understanding beyond the immediately
       available data.
     - Zero-shot learning generalizes from known classes to unseen ones
       using abstract relationships, similar to how non-empirical
       perception may draw conclusions without direct sensory input.

  2. **Use of Auxiliary Information:**
     - Zero-shot learning depends heavily on auxiliary information to
       bridge the gap between known and unknown, akin to how
       non-empirical perception might use prior knowledge, abstract
       concepts, or reasoning.

  3. **Reasoning and Conceptual Mapping:**
     - Zero-shot learning applies relational and semantic information
       for reasoning in classification tasks, much like how
       non-empirical systems rely on conceptual mapping and hypothetical
       reasoning to interpret information.

  4. **Mental Representations:**
     - In cognitive science, non-empirical perceptions may involve
       mental representations of concepts or instances. Similarly,
       zero-shot learning relies on learned representations (like
       embeddings) to make sense of unseen data.

  ### Conclusion:
  While zero-shot learning in AI focuses on computational methods to
  extend learning and classification capabilities, non-empirical
  perception in cognitive sciences refers to the human ability to
  understand and interpret beyond direct sensory data. Both rely on
  using and processing auxiliary information to bridge their respective
  gaps, leading to knowledge or actions beyond what is directly observed
  or previously encountered. This conceptual overlap underscores the
  role of inference, abstraction, and generalization in both fields.
