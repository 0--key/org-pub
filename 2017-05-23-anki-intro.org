* Prelude
  As it indtroduced at its [[https://apps.ankiweb.net/index.html][site]]:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's
  a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either
  greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the
  amount you learn.
  #+END_QUOTE

  Doesn't sound challenging?


* Installation
  There are [[https://apps.ankiweb.net/][several options to install]] =Anki= and I'm pay an attention on a
  ~.deb~ one:

** Download the =.deb= package
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd ~/Downloads
   wget https://apps.ankiweb.net/downloads/current/anki_2.0.45_all.deb
   #+END_SRC

** Install =Anki's= dependencies
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo apt-get install python-qt4 mplayer2 lame libportaudio2 python-sqlalchemy
   # sudo apt --fix-broken install
   #+END_SRC

** Install it into ~Debian9~
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd ~/Downloads
   # ls -la
   sudo dpkg -i anki_2.0.45_all.deb
   #+END_SRC


* Configuring
  For =Gnome= users only to allow =Anki= to pick up the current theme
  from it:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  theme=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme)
  echo "gtk-theme-name=$theme" >> ~/.gtkrc-2.0
  echo "export GTK2_RC_FILES=$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0" >> ~/.profile
  #+END_SRC


* Testing
  
** Log out and log back
   into your session
