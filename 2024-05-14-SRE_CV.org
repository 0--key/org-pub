       science, engineering, or a related field[1][2].
     
  2. *Experience*:
     - Aspiring SRE professionals should gain at least two to four years
       of related work experience in IT operations and software
       development[1].
     
  3. *Skills*:
     - *Hard Skills*:
       - Strong IT knowledge and skills.
       - Data analysis.
       - Writing code to fix software issues and automate processes.
       - Database management.
       - CI/CD pipeline development[1].
     - *Soft Skills*:
       - Communication and presentation skills.
       - Time management and organizational skills.
       - Strong collaboration and teamwork skills.
       - Creative problem solving[1].
     
  4. *Tools and Programs*:
     - Familiarity with tools like Grafana, JIRA, Terraform, Datadog,
       Ansible, and SaltStack is beneficial for SREs[1].
  
  5. *Certifications and Courses*:
     - Completing courses like Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
       Foundation, Site Reliability Engineering: Measuring and Managing
       Reliability, or obtaining a Professional Certificate in Site
       Reliability Engineering can enhance one's qualifications[1].
  
  6. *Career Path*:
     - Many SREs start their careers in roles like software engineer,
       developer, IT support specialist, or systems administrator before
       transitioning to an SRE role[1].

** ToolBox

  Some /common tools/ used by Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) include:
  
  1. *Prometheus*:
     - An open-source software used for monitoring and collecting
       metrics about infrastructure and applications. It works well with
       Kubernetes and offers extensive features and plugin support[3].
  
  2. *Grafana*:
     - An open-source analytics and monitoring tool used to visualize
       data and metrics. It supports various data sources like
       Prometheus, MySQL, Elasticsearch, AWS, and more, allowing for
       customizable dashboards and alerts[3].
  
  3. *Kibana*:
     - A dashboard visualization software popular among SREs. It works
       in conjunction with Elasticsearch and provides insights into
       system health by analyzing logs, metrics, and traces[3].
  
  4. *Datadog*:
     - A monitoring and analytics tool used by IT and DevOps teams to
       monitor services like servers and databases. It collects events
       and metrics, providing insights into monitoring and performance
       data[3].
  
  5. *Splunk*:
     - Used for monitoring and searching through big data, Splunk
       indexes and correlates information for searchability, alerting,
       reporting, and visualization. It collects and analyzes high
       volumes of network and machine data in real-time[3].
  
  6. *New Relic*:
     - A Software as a Service offering focusing on performance and
       availability monitoring. It uses an application performance index
       (Apdex) score to rate application performance and provides
       insights for building better software[3].
  
  7. *Elasticsearch*:
     - A distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache
       Lucene. It is commonly used for log analytics, full-text search,
       security intelligence, business analytics, and operational
       intelligence use cases[3].
  
  8. *Dynatrace*:
     - A monitoring tool that provides insights into application
       performance and user experience. It offers real-time monitoring,
       AI-powered analytics, and automation to optimize system
       performance[3].
  
  9. *AppDynamics*:
     - An application performance management and IT operations analytics
       tool that provides real-time insights into application
       performance, user experience, and business impact[3].
  
  10. *Zabbix*:
