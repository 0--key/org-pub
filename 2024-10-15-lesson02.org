* Preamble

During our last lesson, we discovered that over the first *17 years*
of life, a human typically acquires knowledge of the meanings of
approximately *40,000 to 50,000 words*. In this lesson, let's explore
how we might /accelerate this process/, acquiring a similar vocabulary
in a shorter period.

We will consider various methods and strategies that could enhance 
vocabulary acquisition, focusing on efficient learning techniques. 
These might include immersion in language-rich environments, utilizing 
technology and language-learning apps, and engaging in intensive 
reading and writing activities. 

Additionally, we will discuss memory-enhancing techniques such as 
mnemonics, spaced repetition, and deliberate practice. By understanding 
and applying these strategies, we aim to uncover ways to expedite the 
process of building a robust and extensive vocabulary efficiently. 
Through active participation and discussion, we'll work together to 
develop practical approaches for achieving rapid language mastery.

* A Precious Time

Let's consider that a child spends approximately 65,700 hours
developing fluency in 50,000 words in their native language. What if
our goal is to achieve the same amount of linguistic knowledge, but 10
times fasterâ€”instead of 15 years, in just 18 months? Is it possible to
learn the meaning of 13 words per hour instead of 1.3 words per hour?

*For a while, Yes!*

To explore this ambitious goal, we must consider accelerated learning 
techniques and strategies that could facilitate such rapid vocabulary 
acquisition. These might include:

** Intensive Language Immersion

Engaging in a language-rich environment consistently, where the target
language is used exclusively, can significantly speed up the learning
process.

** Advanced Memory Techniques

Utilizing tools such as mnemonics, spaced repetition systems, and
visualization can help in memorizing and retaining vocabulary more
efficiently.

** Technology and Multimedia Resources

Leveraging language-learning apps, online courses, and multimedia
content provides diverse exposure to vocabulary in various contexts.

** Focused Speaking and Listening Exercises

Regular practice through conversation groups and language exchange
partners helps in reinforcing language skills actively.

** Reading and Writing Intensively

Consuming a wide range of written materials and engaging in writing
tasks can enrich vocabulary and improve comprehension.

** Sum It Up

By employing these strategies and maintaining a disciplined, focused 
approach, it may be possible to significantly accelerate the acquisition 
of a new language. However, such intensive learning requires dedication, 
consistent effort, and a supportive learning environment.


* The Duration Concept

Learning session duration multiplied by its depth.

The number of words 

* The Same Approach For Another Language
