** Seek Them Out

Nowadays, it is quite easy to use the [[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/][Internet]] to hunt for the meaning
of a word: simply find your word used in a quote by someone famously
wise and look it up.

** Mark Twain

1. "The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of
   getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into
   small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one."

   This advice is both practical and motivational, emphasizing the
   power of initiative and incremental progress.

2. "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things
   that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the
   bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in
   your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."

   This encourages a proactive and adventurous approach to life,
   urging people to embrace opportunities and experiences."

3. "Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can
   see."

   It speaks to the universal power of compassion and empathy,
   transcending physical limitations and fostering human connection."

4. "Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time
   to pause and reflect."

   This quote invites critical thinking and the courage to challenge
   conformity, encouraging individuals to consider their unique
   perspectives."

5. "The most interesting information comes from children, for they
   tell all they know and then stop."

   This humorously highlights the straightforwardness and honesty of
   children, offering insight into a simple, unfiltered worldview."

6. "Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of
   fear."

   This distinguishes between the absence of fear and the conscious
   effort to confront and manage it, a valuable lesson in facing
   life's challenges."

7. "The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot
   read."

   It underscores the importance of reading and education, suggesting
   that neglecting to learn is akin to being unable to learn."

------

** Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill

1. "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to
   continue that counts. It means that every achievement is just a
   step in a longer journey and that setbacks are not the end but
   rather opportunities to gather strength and persist."

2. "To each, there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they
   are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to
   do a very special thing, unique to them and fitted to their
   talents. What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or
   unqualified for that which could have been their finest hour."

3. "We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing
   grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall
   fight in the hills; we shall never surrender. This powerful
   encouragement exemplifies the unwavering resolve and determination
   needed in the face of adversity."

4. "The empires of the future are the empires of the mind. It
   underscores the importance of intellectual power, creativity, and
   innovation in shaping the future, emphasizing how mental and
   educational achievements define real power."

5. "When you have to kill a man, it costs nothing to be polite. This
   rhetorical remark suggests that civility should be maintained
   regardless of the situation, subtly highlighting the value of
   maintaining one's dignity and politeness."

6. "It is not enough that we do our best; sometimes we must do what is
   required. This speaks to going beyond personal limits and striving
   to meet the demands of a situation, showing dedication and
   responsibility."

7. "Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also
   what it takes to sit down and listen. It highlights the dual nature
   of courage, not just in expressing oneself but also in listening
   and understanding others."

------

** Siddhartha Gautama

1. "Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. Those who are
   victorious in war cannot find it; those who conquer only themselves
   can. True serenity is found through internal harmony and
   self-understanding, rather than external achievements."

2. "Holding onto anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of
   throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned. This
   teaching emphasizes the self-harm caused by harboring resentment
   and the importance of letting go for personal peace."

3. "Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without
   a spiritual life. It implies that for a fulfilling life, nurturing
   spiritual awareness and growth is as crucial as tending to physical
   needs."

4. "Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the
   truth. This illustrates the inevitability of truth prevailing, much
   like the certainty of day and night following one another."

5. "Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate
   the mind on the present moment. Focusing on the present enables one
   to fully engage with life, rather than being consumed by regrets or
   worries about what has yet to come."

6. "We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the
   mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves. It
   highlights the power of positive thinking and the impact of mental
   purity on realizing happiness."

7. "The tongue like a sharp knife... Kills without drawing blood. This
   highlights the significant impact of words, cautioning against
   harmful speech and emphasizing verbal kindness."
