Provide the definition of etimology: the origin, initial meaning and
mutation in meaning and spelling for English.


* Etymology in English Language

#+begin_quote
*Etymology* refers to the study of the origin of words and how their
meanings and forms have changed over time. Understanding etymology
helps in learning vocabulary by tracing back the roots, which often
enhances the grasp of current meanings and usage.
#+end_quote

** Origin

- The English word "etymology" comes from the Greek word "etymologia"
  = (true sense), which is formed from:
  - =etymon=: true meaning of a word
  - =logia=: study or theory

** Initial Meaning

Originally, etymology was the pursuit of discovering a word's original
or true meaning, often linked to its historical roots or connections
to other languages, particularly Latin and Greek in the context of
English.

** Mutation in Meaning

Over time, as the English language has absorbed influences from
various languages through conquest, trade, and cultural exchange, the
meanings of many words have evolved. This led to:

  - Words adopting new meanings.
  - Spelling changes to align phonetically or to denote different usage.
  - Simplification or complex derivations leading to the creation of new words.

** Spelling Changes

Historical spelling variations have occurred due to:

  - Pronunciation shifts (Great Vowel Shift in English).
  - Standardization efforts, such as Samuel Johnson's dictionary.
  - Influence from Norman French, Latin, Greek, and other languages,
    leading to a mix of phonetic and morphological changes.

** Summary

Understanding etymology involves looking at historical records,
linguistic evolution, and cultural influences that contribute to how
words and their meanings have transformed in the English language. It
is a key component in linguistic studies.

=Remember=: Etymology not only sheds light on the history of a
language but also strengthens vocabulary acquisition and comprehension
by providing context and background to word usage.


* Etymology of "Man" and "Men"

** "Man"
- =Old English=: "mann" = person, human being
- =Proto-Germanic=: "*mann-" = person
- Originally, "man" could refer to both males and females, meaning a
  human being in general.
- Over time, "man" became more commonly used to refer specifically to
  an adult male human.

** "Men"
- =Old English=: "menn" = plural of "man"
- Retains the original plurality and form from Old English.
- Shift from general human beings to more gender-specific usage in
  line with "man."


* Etymology of "Woman" and "Women"

** "Woman"
- =Old English=: "wīfmann" = woman, female human
  - "wīf" = female
  - "mann" = person
- The word "woman" evolved from the compound; "wīfmann" eventually
  dropped the "f" sound, leading to "woman."
- Reflects the combination of "wīf" (female) and "mann" (person) to
  specify a female person.

** "Women"
- =Old English=: "wīfmen" = plural of "wīfmann"
- The plural spelling reflects the typical pattern for Old English
  plurals, even as pronunciation shifted.
- The change in pronunciation and spelling mirrors natural linguistic
  evolution to maintain clarity in plural form.

** Summary
The words "man," "men," "woman," and "women" illustrate the evolution
of English from its Old English roots, displaying how societal and
linguistic changes influenced gender-specific terminology. These
changes highlight both morphological simplifications and cultural
patterns in language use over centuries.


* Evolution of the Spelling of "Women"

** Origin and Old English
The word originates from =Old English=: "wīfmen" or "wīfmann" = plural
of female person. Initially, the pronunciation followed a more
phonetic rule with clear distinction between singular and plural
forms.

** Middle English Changes
During the Middle English period, pronunciation and spelling began to
shift. The vowel change:

  - "Wīfmen" became "wymmen" and later "wommen" as a reflection of
    vowel shifts.
  - The shift from "i" to "o" or "e" reflects typical linguistic vowel
    transformations in English where vowels alter sound and spelling,
    influenced by the Great Vowel Shift.

** Early Modern English

By Early Modern English, the spelling began to stabilize. The
influence of print and standardization efforts led to the more
consistent usage of "women" as the accepted form. Spelling was often
dictated by leading figures in English scribes and printing, which
helped solidify "women" as both the recognized spelling and
pronunciation.

** Summary

The word "women" experienced significant changes influenced by:

  - =Vowel shifts=: his occurred naturally and gradually over the centuries.
  - =Standardization efforts=: Early print culture and standardization contributed to the current spelling.
  - This evolution showcases typical orthographic shifts in English
    whereby historical and phonetic influences have converged to form
    the modern spelling.


#+begin_quote
=Conclusion=: The earlier variant "weemen" reflects older phonetic
emphasis, showing the dynamic nature of English spelling and
pronunciation through periods of linguistic transition.

* Pronunciation and Spelling Variance in "Women"

** Middle English Influence

During the Middle English period, the pronunciation of many words
began to shift due to various influences, including:

  - =Regional dialects=: These diversified pronunciations.
  - =Norman Conquest=: Introduced new sounds and spellings.

** Great Vowel Shift

The Great Vowel Shift (15th to 18th century) significantly altered
English vowel pronunciation. During this period:

  - Pronunciations were affected by a chain reaction among vowels,
    where early vowels became higher and closer in the mouth,
    sometimes altering their sound completely.
  - The spelling of "women" retained historical consistency for
    recognition, even though pronunciation shifted.

** Influence of Standardization

Early printers and standardizing efforts affected spelling but did not
always align with regional pronunciation changes, which had a more
immediate influence on spoken language. The spelling "women" preserved
traditional orthographic conventions.

** Modern Pronunciation

Today, "women" is an example of English words where spelling does not
perfectly match pronunciation:

  - "o" in "women" aligns with [ʊ] due to historical phonetic
    transcription, while "e" represents the current tense "i" sound
    [ɪ] in "men."
  
** Summary

The pronunciation of "women" reflects:

  - Historical pronunciation patterns.
  - Influence from language standardization while phonetic rules
    shifted independently.

English contains many words with mismatched spelling and sounds due to
its complex linguistic history.


* Etymology of Hiberno-English "Wee"

** Origin

=Middle English=: "wee" originates from the Middle English word "wei,"
which was derived from: =Old English=: "wēage," meaning little or
small.
  
** Proto-Germanic Roots

Derived from =Proto-Germanic=: "*wiwaz" or similar reconstructions,
indicating smallness or minuteness.

** Use in Scottish and Ulster Scots

"Wee" was prominently used in Scots and later in Ulster Scots,
influencing its adoption in regions of Ireland. The word retained its
meaning of "small" or "little," often used affectionately.

** Hiberno-English Adoption

"Wee" was absorbed into Hiberno-English through the significant
Scottish influence on Ulster dialects and settlements in Ireland,
particularly Northern Ireland. In Hiberno-English, "wee" is frequently
used as a diminutive adjective, often to convey endearment, affection,
or familiarity.

** Contemporary Usage

"Wee" remains a part of everyday vocabulary in Ireland and Scotland,
maintaining its core meaning. It's commonly used to describe size or
insignificant amounts but can also imply affection or familiarity with
an object or person.

** Summary

The word "wee" exemplifies how regional dialects influence and
contribute to broader language varieties. Its endurance is attributed
to cultural exchanges and regional dialect preservation, maintaining
the simplicity and attachment of its original meaning of smallness.


* Conclusion

The disparity between spelling and pronunciation in =women= is
emblematic of broader changes in the English language, illustrating
the tension between historical orthography and phonetic evolution.

In another hand, =wee= offers a fascinating glimpse into the dynamic
exchange between English dialects and underscores how cultural and
linguistic intersections impact language development and usage.



* Pronunciation of "Women" as [ˈwɪmɪn]                             :noexport:

Q: Why the word `women` pronounced as [wimin]?

** Historical Linguistic Shift
- The word "women" comes from the Old English “wīfmen,” with an evolution of pronunciation through time.

** Vowel Change
- =Middle English Period=: This period experienced changes in vowel sounds, influenced by dialectical diversity and phonetic evolution.
- The specific "o" to "i" vowel change:
  - The first vowel “o” in "women" shifted to an “i” sound [ɪ], influenced by phonetic simplification which occurred before consistency in spelling conventions was established.

** Influence of the Great Vowel Shift
- Although little impact on the [ˈwɪmɪn] pronunciation, the period
  highlighted the divergence between spelling and pronunciation,
  contributing to future irregularities.

** Standardization
- The written form stabilized with "o" due to historical spelling
  conventions, despite shifts in spoken language using “i.”
- In English, standardization focused more on uniformity over phonetic
  precision, leading to mismatches like "women."

** Phonetic Influence
- The retention of phonetic pronunciation with [ˈwɪmɪn]:
  - Societal and regional influence kept the “i” pronunciation despite orthographic fixation on “o.”
  - Variety and evolution through English dialects solidified the [wɪ] sound, making it the norm.

** Summary
- "Women" demonstrates how English words adopt phonetic shapes through
  historical shifts and non-standardized spelling practices.
- The pronunciation is a remnant of changing linguistics preserved in
  speech but not in orthography.

=Conclusion=: The divergence between spoken and written form in
"women" highlights the complexity of English phonetic and orthographic
histories, showcasing how practical usage often deviates from
standardized written forms.  ``` #+end_src
