* Introduction

Developed in the 1950s by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom and
his colleagues, the Original Taxonomy of Educational Objectives is a
framework designed to classify educational goals, objectives, and
outcomes. It serves as a foundational tool for curriculum development,
instruction, and assessment in education.

* Structure of the Taxonomy

The original taxonomy is structured as a hierarchy of cognitive
skills, categorized into six levels, each representing increasing
levels of complexity in thinking and learning.

** Knowledge

   - The ability to recall or recognize facts and basic concepts.
   - *Examples*: Memorizing definitions, listing facts.

** Comprehension

   - The ability to understand information, summarize, and interpret
     it.
   - *Examples*: Explaining ideas, summarizing readings.

** Application

   - The ability to use learned material in new and concrete
     situations.
   - *Examples*: Solving problems, applying theories to new
     situations.

** Analysis

   - The ability to break down information into parts and understand
     its structure.
   - *Examples*: Identifying motives, analyzing arguments.

** Synthesis

   - The ability to combine information to form a new whole or propose
     new ideas.
   - *Examples*: Designing a new experiment, writing a cohesive paper.

** Evaluation

   - The ability to make judgments based on criteria and standards.
   - *Examples*: Assessing the validity of a theory, critiquing a
     piece of work.

* Specific Questions

These questions aligned with each level of =Bloom's Taxonomy= help
educators and learners focus on the appropriate cognitive processes
necessary for mastering content and developing critical thinking
skills. This structured approach to questioning enhances engagement
and promotes deeper understanding throughout the learning experience.

-----

** Comprehension (Understanding)
   - =What is the summary of <object>?=
   - =How would you explain <concept> in your own words?=
   - =What are the main ideas of <text>?=
   - =How would you interpret <data or findings>?=
   - =Can you compare and contrast <object A> and <object B>?=
-----

** Knowledge (Remembering)
   - =What is <object>?=
   - =What are the facts about <object>?=
   - =Can you list the key components of <object>?=
   - =Who is associated with <object>?=
   - =When did <event> happen?=
-----

** Application (Applying)
   - =How can you apply <concept> to a real-world situation?=
   - =In what ways can you use <knowledge> to solve <problem>?=
   - =Can you demonstrate how to use <method or technique>?=
   - =What would you do if <scenario>?=
   - =How can you illustrate <concept> with an example?=
-----

** Analysis (Analyzing)
   - =What are the parts of <object> and how do they relate to each other?=
   - =Can you identify the underlying assumptions of <argument or theory>?=
   - =How would you classify <data> into different categories?=
   - =What are the relationships between <object A> and <object B>?=
   - =Can you break down the process of <task or concept>?=
-----

** Synthesis (Creating)
   - =How can you combine elements of <concept> to create something new?=
   - =What is a new proposal for addressing <issue>?=
   - =Can you design a plan using <knowledge or methods>?=
   - =How would you rearrange <information> to improve understanding?=
   - =What kind of new solutions can you formulate for <problem>?=
-----

** Evaluation (Evaluating)
   - =What criteria would you use to judge <object or process>?=
   - =How would you assess the validity of <theory or claim>?=
   - =What are the strengths and weaknesses of <object>?=
   - =Can you compare the effectiveness of <strategy A> versus <strategy B>?=
   - =What is your opinion on <issue> and how did you reach this conclusion?=

* Purpose and Benefits

** Curriculum Development

Provides a systematic approach for educators to formulate learning
objectives that cater to a range of cognitive skills.

** Instructional Planning

Helps teachers design lesson plans and learning activities that engage
students at multiple levels of cognitive complexity.

** Assessment Design

Creates a framework for developing assessments that align with desired
educational outcomes, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of student
learning.

* Impact on Education

Bloom's Taxonomy has significantly influenced educational practices,
promoting a focus on higher-order thinking skills and encouraging a
more active, engaging approach to learning. It has paved the way for
revised taxonomies, recognizing the need to adapt and evolve as
educational paradigms change.

* Conclusion

#+begin_quote
~Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives~ provides a foundational
understanding of different cognitive processes involved in
learning. By guiding educators in /setting clear and structured
goals/, it enhances both teaching strategies and student learning
outcomes, promoting a /more robust educational experience/.

* Notes                                                            :noexport:

So, as I can comprehend, in accordion with Bloom's =Taxonomy of
Educational Objectives= the main questions

for first level is:
"What is <object>?"

for second level is:
"What is the summary of <object>?"

Extend the list of general questions for each level of complexity.
