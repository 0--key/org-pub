In 1976, the economist and historian Carlo M. Cipolla (1922–2000)
wrote an essay titled “The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity” where he
defines the five “laws of stupidity” as:

1. Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid
   individuals in circulation;
2. The probability that a certain person will be stupid is independent
   of any other characteristic of that person;
3. A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or
   a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly
   incurring losses;
4. Nonstupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid
   individuals;
5. A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.
