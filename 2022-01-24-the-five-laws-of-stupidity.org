In 1976, the economist and historian Carlo M. Cipolla (1922–2000)
wrote an essay titled “The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity” where he
defines the five “laws of stupidity” as:

1. Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid
   individuals in circulation;

   The compilers of the Testament were aware of the First Basic Law,
   and they paraphrased it when they asserted that:

   #+begin_quote
   “stultorum infinitus est numerus”
   #+end_quote

   But they indulged in /poetic exaggeration/. The number of stupid
   people cannot be infinite because the number of living people is
   finite.
2. The probability that a certain person will be stupid is independent
   of any other characteristic of that person;

   #+begin_quote
   A stupid man is born a stupid man by an act of Providence.
   #+end_quote

3. A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or
   a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly
   incurring losses;
4. Nonstupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid
   individuals;
5. A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.
