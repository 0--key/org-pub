* Preface
For which purposes ~Rye~ package is used for?

#+begin_src markdown
The `Rye` package in Python is primarily designed for handling
dependency management and installation of Python packages across
different environments. It serves several key purposes, including:

1. **Package Management:** Rye allows users to manage their Python
   project dependencies efficiently. It aims to simplify the process
   of adding, removing, and updating packages.

2. **Environment Management:** It supports the creation and management
   of isolated environments for Python projects, helping developers
   manage dependencies specific to each project without conflicts.

3. **Simplified Commands:** Rye offers a user-friendly command-line
   interface that aims to reduce the complexity of managing
   environments and dependencies compared to other tools like `pip`
   and `virtualenv`.

4. **Lock Files:** Similar to other dependency managers, Rye can
   generate lock files to ensure consistency across different
   environments. This helps in replicating the exact environment setup
   in separate machines or stages.

5. **Cross-Platform Support:** Rye is designed to work across
   different operating systems, facilitating a smoother experience for
   developers working in varied environments.

For comprehensive usage and examples, you can refer to the [Rye
documentation](https://rye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This resource
includes in-depth guides on installation, configuration, and typical
workflows for using Rye effectively.
