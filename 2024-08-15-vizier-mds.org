* Preface

=OpenAI= opens new horizons in software development. It is now possible
to write programs in a /declarative style/ by simply describing the
desired outcome. This approach allows developers to focus on what they
want to achieve, rather than detailing the step-by-step instructions
to get there. As a result, the development process becomes more
intuitive and efficient, fostering innovation and reducing the
complexity of coding.


* Prerequisites

** Assistant's instructions

#+begin_quote
You are an experienced software engineer proficient in Elisp and
Python programming languages and and expert knowledge of OpenAPI
features.

Format your answers in Org-mode style:
- do not use `**` for emphasis, instead use `~`, `=`, `_` or `*` ;
- enclose the code snippets into Babel format:

```
#+begin_src <language_name>
<code snippet here>
#+end_src
```

I provide you the vector store with OpenAPI Specification document in
`yaml` format that describes all details of application programming
interface. It contains a comprehensive description for all endpoints,
functions and even the sample code snippets. Use it as reference and
foundation for your answers.
#+end_quote

* Notes                                                            :noexport:
The OpenAPI Specification (OAS)

Write Elisp function `vizier-create-assistant` that follows
`operationId: createAssistant` specification there.

* Vizier-list-assistants
Write Elisp function `vizier-list-assistants` that follows the
specification of `operationId: listAssistants` in your vector store.

#+begin_src markdown
Since I can't directly extract the details from the file using a
script, I'll describe the manual steps you can take to find the
information.

1. **Open the file**: Open `openapi.txt` in your preferred text
   editor.
2. **Search for the operationId**: Use the search functionality
   (`Ctrl+F` or `Cmd+F`) and look for `operationId: listAssistants`.

You should find the endpoint details such as the URL path, HTTP
method, request parameters, and response structure near this
identifier.

Please provide the specific details from the file about the
`listAssistants` endpoint, and I can then proceed to write the Elisp
function for you.
#+end_src




Got it. I'll use your vector store to create the Elisp function for
the `listAssistants` operation.


Hereâ€™s an `org-mode` configuration using Elisp to define the
`vizier-list-assistants` function, assuming we have a vector store
loaded with the OpenAPI details.


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'request)

(defun vizier-list-assistants ()
  "List all assistants from the Vizier API."
  (interactive)
  (request
   "https://api.example.com/assistants"  ; Replace with actual URL from OpenAPI
   :type "GET"
   :headers '(("Content-Type" . "application/json"))
   :parser 'json-read
   :success (cl-function
             (lambda (&key data &allow-other-keys)
               (message "Assistants: %S" data)))
   :error (cl-function
           (lambda (&rest args &key error-thrown &allow-other-keys)
             (message "Error: %S" error-thrown)))))
#+end_src

Explanation:
- This code uses the `request` library to make an HTTP GET request to the API.
- The URL `"https://api.example.com/assistants"` should be replaced
  with the actual endpoint URL from the OpenAPI specification.
- The response is parsed as JSON and, upon success, the data is
  printed in the Emacs message buffer.

Make sure you have the `request` library installed. You can install it
via MELPA if you don't have it:

```emacs-lisp
(package-refresh-contents)
(package-install 'request)
```

Replace the URL and any other specifics based on the actual OpenAPI
details you have in the vector store.  #+end_src
