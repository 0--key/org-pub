* Overview

  *What is MariaDB*

  - A /branch/ of MySQL
    - MariaDB is a backward compatible, drop-in replacement for the
      MySQL Database Server
  - Open Source
    - The source code for MariaDB is publicly available from Launchpad
    - All code in MariaDB is open source
    - Open bugs database


  *Thus, just open-source kind of MySQL*  

* Installation

  MariaDB included into official =Debian= repository, hence its
  installation as usual is a string as ~root~:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ~# apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Installation success check is possible for ordinary user also:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  mariadb --version
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : mariadb  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.1.23-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 5.2

* Initial steps

  thus there are several steps how to permit ordinary ~UNIX user~ to
  interact with SQL server on localhost.

** Test DB creation

** Dumb DB user creation

** Test user priviledges granting
