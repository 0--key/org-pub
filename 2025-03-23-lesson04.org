*Glossary*

#+begin_quote
In the context of language and linguistics, =prosody= refers to the
patterns of rhythm, stress, and intonation in spoken language. It
encompasses several elements:

- =Rhythm:= The flow and timing of speech, including the duration of
  syllables and pauses.
- =Stress:= The emphasis placed on certain syllables or words, which
  can affect meaning and contribute to the natural rhythm of speech.
- =Intonation:= The variation in pitch while speaking, which can
  convey different meanings, emotions, or questions.

Prosody is important for understanding the nuances of language, as it
can affect the emotional tone and clarity of the spoken message.

#+begin_quote
In the context of Hiberno-English (the variety of English spoken in
Ireland), =pitch= refers to the perceived frequency of sound in
speech, contributing to the melody or musical quality of spoken
language. In Hiberno-English, pitch can play a significant role in
communication for several reasons:

- =Intonation Patterns:= Pitch variations often create distinctive
  intonation patterns. Hiberno-English is known for its unique
  intonation, which can be more varied and musical compared to other
  English varieties.

- =Expressing Emotion and Meaning:= Changes in pitch can convey
  emotional nuances or emphasize certain parts of speech. In
  Hiberno-English, shifts in pitch can indicate questions, statements,
  irony, or emphasis, adding layers of meaning beyond the words alone.

- =Regional Variation:= Different regions in Ireland may exhibit
  variations in pitch usage, contributing to the distinctiveness of
  local dialects and accents within Hiberno-English.

Overall, in Hiberno-English, as in other dialects, pitch is an
essential component of prosody, crucial for expressing emotion,
intent, and meaning.

** Ae Fond Kiss

'Ae Fond Kiss' is the most famous and widely acclaimed song to arise
from Robert Burns's association with Agnes McLehose, an educated woman
whom he met whilst in Edinburgh in 1787 and who was separated from her
husband James McLehose, a Glasgow lawyer.

The lovers exchanged a wealth of letters in which they refer to each
other as 'Sylvander' and 'Clarinda'. Mrs McLehose inspired some of
Burns's most famous works including the song 'Ae fond Kiss'.

Agnes McLehose arranged an introduction to Robert Burns by a mutual
friend, Miss Erskine Nimmo (b.1731), and following this the couple
embarked on a lengthy and, at times, passionate correspondence,
sometimes writing to each other twice in one day (over the years 1787
and 1788).

This being said, Agnes McLehose remained aware of her controversial
status as a married, yet separated woman, living alone and dependent
upon the generosity of her cousin, William Craig (1745-1813).

She was deeply concerned with propriety and confidentiality, and so it
was partly to protect both her own and Burns's privacy and reputation
that she suggested the noms d'amours 'Sylvander' and 'Clarinda'.

There is nothing concrete to suggest that the relationship was ever
consummated, yet one can derive from the letters that the couple were
certainly taken with each other for a time.

Following Robert Burns's departure from Edinburgh in 1788, it is
apparent that the correspondents' friendship suffered owing to Burns's
reunion with Jean Armour and their eventual marriage, not to mention
the birth of his illegitimate child to Jenny Clow, Agnes McLehose's
maid.

In 1792 Agnes McLehose travelled to the West Indies on the Roselle at
the request of her estranged husband who, it appears, wished to affect
reconciliation. Robert Burns, upon learning of this plan, wrote the
song 'Ae Fond Kiss' and sent it to Agnes McLehose on the 27th of
December 1791.

Burns's use of the song to express his distress at the finality of the
pair's relationship is both dramatic and emotive. 'Ae Fond Kiss'
conveys sincere, powerful notions of love, and yet a sense of deep
despair and hopelessness is ever present. For this reason it is one of
the most moving songs ever written in response to loss and heartbreak.

#+begin_verse
Ae fond kiss, and then we sever; 
Ae fareweel, and then for ever!
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee, 
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee. 
Who shall say that Fortune grieves him, 
While the star of hope she leaves him? 
Me, nae cheerful twinkle lights me; 
Dark despair around benights me. 

I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy, 
Naething could resist my Nancy: 
But to see her was to love her; 
Love but her, and love for ever. 
Had we never lov'd sae kindly, 
Had we never lov'd sae blindly, 
Never met-or never parted, 
We had ne'er been broken-hearted. 

Fare-thee-weel, thou first and fairest! 
Fare-thee-weel, thou best and dearest! 
Thine be ilka joy and treasure, 
Peace, Enjoyment, Love and Pleasure! 
Ae fond kiss, and then we sever! 
Ae fareweel alas, for ever! 
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee, 
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee.

Перевод С.Маршака

#+begin_verse
РАССТАВАНИЕ


      Поцелуй - и до могилы
      Мы простимся, друг мой милый.
      Ропот сердца отовсюду
      Посылать к тебе я буду.

      В ком надежды искра тлеет,
      На судьбу роптать не смеет.
      Но ни зги передо мною.
      Окружен я тьмой ночною.

      Не кляну своей я страсти.
      Кто твоей не сдастся власти?
      Кто видал тебя, тот любит,
      Кто полюбит, не разлюбит.

      Не любить бы нам так нежно,
      Безрассудно, безнадежно,
      Не сходиться, не прощаться,
      Нам бы с горем не встречаться!

      Будь же ты благословенна,
      Друг мой первый, друг бесценный.
      Да сияет над тобою
      Солнце счастья и покоя.

      Поцелуй - и до могилы
      Мы простимся, друг мой милый.
      Ропот сердца отовсюду
      Посылать к тебе я буду.

* Proverbs and Sayings (15 minutes)

#+begin_quote
 A =proverb= is a short, commonly known saying that expresses a
general truth, piece of advice, or moral lesson. Proverbs are
typically concise and use figurative language or metaphor to convey
their message in a memorable way. They are often passed down through
generations and are part of the cultural wisdom of a society. For
example, the proverb "A stitch in time saves nine" advises that it is
better to address a problem promptly to prevent it from becoming
larger.

Here are ten proverbs that emphasize the values of diligence,
perseverance, and persistence:

1. "Rome wasn't built in a day."
2. "Slow and steady wins the race."
3. "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."
4. "The early bird catches the worm."
5. "Fortune favors the brave."
6. "Where there's a will, there's a way."
7. "No pain, no gain."
8. "Little strokes fell great oaks."
9. "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."
10. "Practice makes perfect."

These proverbs highlight the importance of consistent effort and
determination in achieving success.


* Translation (25 minutes)

Here's a modern adaptation of a well-known Zen story involving two
Tibetan monks, which conveys a moral lesson about letting go:

-----

Two Tibetan monks, an elder and a younger, were traveling together on
a long journey when they came across a wide, swift river. As they were
about to cross, they noticed a woman sitting by the riverbank,
distressed because she was unable to cross the river by herself.

The elder monk offered to help. With the woman's consent, he picked
her up and carried her across the river, setting her down safely on
the other side. The woman thanked him and went on her way.

The monks continued their journey in silence. Hours passed, and the
younger monk couldn't keep his feelings to himself any longer. He
turned to the elder monk and said, "Brother, we are supposed to avoid
contact with women. Why did you carry her?"

The elder monk replied, "I set her down by the river hours ago, but
*you are still carrying her with you*."

-----

This fable teaches a lesson about the importance of letting go of
unnecessary burdens and not holding onto thoughts or worries that can
weigh us down.
