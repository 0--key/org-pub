A dusk at early November morning is dense and viscous like a tar. No
wind at all, all are still in a silence soaked with scents
abundance. The grass, leaves, blackberries and soil's odors twisted
with rich aroma of the ocean bay dizzying your mind, but sooth your
soul. The stars gazing at this keep quiet and twinkle one to another.
