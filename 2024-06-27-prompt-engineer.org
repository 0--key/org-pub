The thig is that I have a huge experience in gaining knowledge by
myself. Last 30 years I've spent in incessant learning English,
Python, Literate Programming with Emacs text editor and alongside with
this reflect myself and obtain a meta-knowledge about the learning as
the process of improvement thyself. This was long and tedious journey
and I've gained proficiency in suppressing cognitive biases, use
hunger, delayed gratification by food, circadian rhytms and spaced
repetition technique to leverage the efficiency of learning.

How do describe all these things in the cover letter?
