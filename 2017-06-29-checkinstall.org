* Prelude

  The oldest, native /UNIX/ thus frightening for newcomers approach
  for software installation is to build it out from sources.

* Checkinstall

  It is a tool for creating /packages/ which allow to manage software
  in a bit convenient manner. Just install it by:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo apt-get install checkinstall
  #+END_SRC

  And all packages which required for software building on your
  =localhost= would be installed simultaneously.

  Now it's a time to review =checkinstall= manual:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  checkinstall is a program that monitors an installation procedure
  (such as make install, install.sh ), and creates a standard package
  for your dis‚Äê tribution (currently deb, rpm and tgz packages are
  supported) that you can install through your distribution's package
  management system (dpkg, rpm or installpkg).
