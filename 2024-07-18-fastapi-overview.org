From what I understand, FastAPI is a lightweight Python library
designed for the efficient development of web servers, specializing in
processing HTTP requests and returning data in JSON format. Am I
right?
#+end_quote

#+begin_src markdown
Yes, you are correct! FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web
framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python
type hints. Here are some key points about FastAPI that align with
your understanding and expand on it:

1. **High Performance**: FastAPI is designed to be very fast and
   efficient, leveraging the asynchronous capabilities of Python and
   the performance of the Starlette framework and Pydantic library. It
   can handle a large number of simultaneous connections efficiently.

2. **Type Hints and Data Validation**: FastAPI uses Python's type
   hints to provide automatic validation, serialization, and
   documentation of the request and response data. This makes
   development faster and easier, while reducing the likelihood of
   bugs.

3. **Asynchronous Support**: It natively supports asynchronous
   programming, which is especially useful for I/O-bound and
   high-latency operations like database access and web requests.

4. **Automatic Interactive Documentation**: FastAPI generates
   interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc out of the
   box, which is incredibly useful for development and debugging.

5. **Ease of Use**: FastAPI is designed to be easy to use and learn,
   without sacrificing flexibility and performance. It aims to provide
   a good developer experience with features like dependency injection
   and easy-to-write route handlers.

6. **JSON Handling**: One of the core functionalities of FastAPI is
   handling JSON data efficiently. It automatically converts request
   payloads to Python objects and vice versa, making it ideal for
   building RESTful APIs.

Here's a simple example of a FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str = None
    price: float
    tax: float = None

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return item
```

In this example:

- The FastAPI instance is created using `FastAPI()`.
- The `Item` model is defined using Pydantic `BaseModel`, which
  supports validation and data conversion.
- The `create_item` function defines an endpoint that receives an
  `Item`, processes it (here, it just returns the same item), and it
  will automatically have the correct type validation and JSON
  handling.

For further reading and more detailed information, you can explore the
official FastAPI documentation: [FastAPI
Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). It covers comprehensive
details with examples and best practices.

** The Appropriate Answer Format Request

#+begin_quote
I'm use Emacs with Org-mode and Babel, so can you format your answers
appropriately?
#+end_quote

#+begin_src markdown
Sure! If you're using Emacs with Org-mode and Babel, I can format the
answer accordingly using Org-mode's syntax for code blocks and
structured text.

Here is the same information formatted for Org-mode with code blocks:

** Overview of FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for
building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

- *High Performance*: FastAPI is designed to be very fast and
  efficient, leveraging the asynchronous capabilities of Python and
  the performance of the Starlette framework and Pydantic library. It
  can handle a large number of simultaneous connections efficiently.

- *Type Hints and Data Validation*: FastAPI uses Python's type hints
  to provide automatic validation, serialization, and documentation of
  the request and response data. This makes development faster and
  easier, while reducing the likelihood of bugs.

- *Asynchronous Support*: It natively supports asynchronous
  programming, which is especially useful for I/O-bound and
  high-latency operations like database access and web requests.

- *Automatic Interactive Documentation*: FastAPI generates
  interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc out of the
  box, which is incredibly useful for development and debugging.

- *Ease of Use*: FastAPI is designed to be easy to use and learn,
  without sacrificing flexibility and performance. It aims to provide
  a good developer experience with features like dependency injection
  and easy-to-write route handlers.

- *JSON Handling*: One of the core functionalities of FastAPI is
  handling JSON data efficiently. It automatically converts request
  payloads to Python objects and vice versa, making it ideal for
  building RESTful APIs.

** Example FastAPI Application
Here is a simple example of a FastAPI application:

#+begin_src python
  from fastapi import FastAPI
  from pydantic import BaseModel

  app = FastAPI()

  class Item(BaseModel):
      name: str
      description: str = None
      price: float
      tax: float = None

  @app.post("/items/")
  async def create_item(item: Item):
      return item
#+end_src

In this example:

- The FastAPI instance is created using ~FastAPI()~.
- The ~Item~ model is defined using Pydantic ~BaseModel~, which
  supports validation and data conversion.
- The ~create_item~ function defines an endpoint that receives an
  ~Item~, processes it (here, it just returns the same item), and it
  will automatically have the correct type validation and JSON
  handling.

For further reading and more detailed information, you can explore the
official FastAPI documentation: [[https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/][FastAPI Documentation]]. It covers
comprehensive details with examples and best practices.



This should fit well with your Org-mode workflow in Emacs. You can
execute the Python code block directly in Org-mode using Babel if you
have it set up for Python.

** Additional Clarifications

*** What is RESTful API?

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
Interface) is a web API that adheres to the principles of REST
(Representational State Transfer), an architectural style defined by
computer scientist Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation. RESTful
APIs are designed to interact with resources in a stateless manner
over HTTP. Here are the key concepts and principles of RESTful APIs:

1. *Resources and URIs*:
   - Resources, which can be any type of data (e.g., users, posts,
     products), are identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators),
     also known as URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
   - Each resource is represented using a unique URL.

2. *HTTP Methods*:
   - RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on
     resources. The primary methods are:
     - ~GET~: Retrieve a representation of a resource.
     - ~POST~: Create a new resource.
     - ~PUT~: Update an existing resource.
     - ~DELETE~: Delete a resource.
     - ~PATCH~: Partially update a resource.

3. *Statelessness*:
   - Each API call from the client to the server must contain all the
     information needed to understand and process the request.
   - The server does not store any client context between requests,
     making each request independent and self-contained.

4. *Representation*:
   - Resources are represented in different formats such as JSON, XML,
     or HTML, but JSON is the most common format.
   - The server provides the necessary information in response to the
     client's request in the appropriate representation format.

5. *Client-Server Architecture*:
   - The client and server are separated, allowing both to be
     developed and scaled independently.
   - The server handles the business logic and data storage, while the
     client handles the user interface and user interactions.

6. *Cacheability*:
   - Responses can be marked as cacheable or non-cacheable to improve
     performance and scalability.
   - Proper use of caching can reduce the number of requests the
     client makes to the server.

7. *Layered System*:
   - RESTful APIs can be designed to work with intermediaries such as
     proxies, gateways, and load balancers to improve scalability,
     security, and performance.

8. *Uniform Interface*:
   - RESTful APIs have a consistent and predictable interface with
     standardized URIs and HTTP methods, making it easier for
     developers to understand and use the API.

Here's an example of a RESTful API using FastAPI that manages a
collection of items:

**** Example of a RESTful API using FastAPI
#+begin_src python
  from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
  from pydantic import BaseModel
  from typing import List

  app = FastAPI()

  class Item(BaseModel):
      name: str
      description: str = None
      price: float
      tax: float = None

  items = []

  @app.get("/items/", response_model=List[Item])
  async def read_items():
      return items

  @app.post("/items/", response_model=Item)
  async def create_item(item: Item):
      items.append(item)
      return item

  @app.get("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
  async def read_item(item_id: int):
      if item_id >= len(items) or item_id < 0:
          raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
      return items[item_id]

  @app.put("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
  async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
      if item_id >= len(items) or item_id < 0:
          raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
      items[item_id] = item
      return item

  @app.delete("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
  async def delete_item(item_id: int):
      if item_id >= len(items) or item_id < 0:
          raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
      return items.pop(item_id)
#+end_src


This example demonstrates a simple RESTful API with the following endpoints:

- ~GET /items/~: Retrieve a list of items.
- ~POST /items/~: Create a new item.
- ~GET /items/{item_id}~: Retrieve a specific item by its ID.
- ~PUT /items/{item_id}~: Update a specific item by its ID.
- ~DELETE /items/{item_id}~: Delete a specific item by its ID.

The FastAPI framework makes it easy to create these endpoints, handle
validation, and return proper responses.

*** Babel Subtleties

#+begin_quote
I want to ask you do not use = :results output :session = further in
Babel code snippets because I've already defined these properties in a
file header.

So, can you suggest how to test =Example of a RESTful API using
FastAPI= using =unittest= module inside Emacs:
- How to launch =FastAPI= application in Emacs;
- How to launch =unittest= to vefiry correctness of its functioning.
#+end_quote


Sure, we can go through the steps to achieve this in Emacs using
Org-mode, Babel, and the ~unittest~ module in Python. Below are the
steps and code snippets to help you test a FastAPI application using
~unittest~ within Emacs.

**** Steps to Test FastAPI Application Using unittest

1. *Define the FastAPI Application*: You already have the FastAPI
   application defined. We will place this code in an Org-mode code
   block.

2. *Create Unit Tests Using unittest*: We will write unit tests to
   verify the correctness of the FastAPI application.

3. *Launch the FastAPI Application*: We will launch the FastAPI
   application in a separate Org-mode code block, which simulates
   running the server.

4. *Run the Unit Tests*: We will then execute the unit tests to
   ensure everything is functioning correctly.

Here is how you can structure it in your Org-mode file:

**** FastAPI Application
#+begin_src python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str = None
    price: float
    tax: float = None

items = []

@app.get("/items/", response_model=List[Item])
async def read_items():
    return items

@app.post("/items/", response_model=Item)
async def create_item(item: Item):
    items.append(item)
    return item

@app.get("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    if item_id >= len(items) or item_id < 0:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    return items[item_id]

@app.put("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    if item_id >= len(items) or item_id < 0:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    items[item_id] = item
    return item

@app.delete("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
async def delete_item(item_id: int):
    if item_id >= len(items) or item_id < 0:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    return items.pop(item_id)
#+end_src

**** Unit Tests for FastAPI Application
#+begin_src python
import unittest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

# Import the FastAPI ~app~ from the code block above
from __main__ import app

client = TestClient(app)

class TestFastAPI(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_create_item(self):
        response = client.post("/items/", json={"name": "Test Item", "price": 10.5})
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json()["name", "Test Item"])

    def test_read_items(self):
        response = client.get("/items/")
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertIsInstance(response.json(), list)

    def test_update_item(self):
        client.post("/items/", json={"name": "Test Item", "price": 10.5})
        response = client.put("/items/0", json={"name": "Updated Item", "price": 15.0})
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json()["name"], "Updated Item")

    def test_delete_item(self):
        client.post("/items/", json={"name": "Test Item", "price": 10.5})
        response = client.delete("/items/0")
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json()["name"], "Test Item")

    def test_read_nonexistent_item(self):
        response = client.get("/items/999")
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 404)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
#+end_src

**** Launch FastAPI Application
#+begin_src python :eval no
import uvicorn

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
#+end_src

**** Run Unit Tests
#+begin_src python
!pytest test_api.py
#+end_src

*** Explanation

1. *FastAPI Application*: The first code block contains the FastAPI
   application code.

2. *Unit Tests*: The second code block contains the ~unittest~
   implementation. We use ~TestClient~ from ~fastapi.testclient~ to
   simulate requests to the FastAPI application. Each method in the
   ~TestFastAPI~ class corresponds to a test case for different API
   operations.

3. *Launch FastAPI Application*: This block will launch the FastAPI
   application using ~uvicorn~. It's marked with ~:eval no~ to prevent
   accidental execution. You can run this in a terminal.

4. *Run Unit Tests*: This block uses ~pytest~ to run the unit
   tests. You can simply execute this block to see the test results.

To execute the above workflow in Emacs with Org-mode:

1. *Start FastAPI Server*: You can manually run the "Launch FastAPI
   Application" block in a separate terminal to start the FastAPI
   server.

2. *Execute Unit Tests*: Evaluate the "Run Unit Tests" block to run
   your test cases and verify the functionality of your FastAPI
   application.

This setup will help you develop and test a RESTful API using FastAPI
and ~unittest~ within Emacs efficiently.
