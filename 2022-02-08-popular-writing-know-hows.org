* Intro

* Starting out

* Getting better

* Unfair advantages

* How to grow your audience

* Monetisation

And now we have the option to really ramp up the monetizing side of
things and i think monetizing is also where writer versus youtuber
differs quite a lot the nice thing about youtube is that it has
monetization built in you you never have to sell something if you want
or you can like all you have to do is just continue making videos that
are adding value to the audience and because of adsense being a thing
just by default you'll make money on youtube you also tend to find
that once you hit about 10 20 000 subscribers you just start getting
brands reaching out to you being like hey skillshare wants to sponsor
a video brilliant wants to sponsor a video this random telephone brand
wants to sponsor a video and you start getting those inbound
opportunities quite a lot what's it like on the writing side if you're
sort of building an audience on twitter and then kind of sending them
to your blog i think that when it comes to monetization sometimes with
the internet what people do is they treat it like this totally
different world where there's like internet rules and a lot of these
principles that we've been talking about are actually fairly intuitive
and one of the things that happens i don't know if you've been to a
conference but one of the things that happens is you'll talk to
somebody and if they're really impressive like i come to you and i say
hey you know i have all this expertise on youtube and hey you should
do this this and that i give you a couple ideas you're like that's a
pretty good idea we haven't thought about that what are you are going
to say to me hey can i hire you yeah you're going to say that to me so
i don't even have to sell and so that's what you want to do with your
content online you want to get to a place where just like that
conference the potential customer doesn't feel like you're coming at
them and you're like bye bye bye bye for me you want them to come to
you and basically say hey i want to buy from you and even better this
is what i want and so if you have an audience and you can cultivate an
attitude and a skill of listening to what people want and
understanding not just their stated motivations but their implicit
motivations behind what they're saying and deliver a product for that
now you have all of these customers who are knocking at your door and
saying i want to give you money yeah and i guess it was interesting
interesting for you the first time you tweeted out about potentially
starting a writing course yes what was that like yes i totally forgot
about that story good idea so what i did was i was sitting on my couch
and i was like you know what i'm gonna teach a thousand people to
write in 2019. Who's interested so just send out a tweet and at the
time i don't know i had a couple thousand subscribers or a couple
thousand followers on twitter and i got this uncanny flood of direct
messages people from every single continent saying i would love to
learn and so i just started talking to them i just said hey what are
you interested in how can i help and so i was like perfect i'll do a
consulting business and so i started trying to do that i was not a
good consultant there's just a lot of things about that i wasn't very
good at but what i realized was actually this was a really good time
to start an online course business and so i started doing that and so
i turned right a passage into a product and i started monetizing and
over time i've raised the price and i've done a much better job of
listening to what people want and then building an experience for them
but what's really important is we got two multi-million dollars in
revenue and i didn't spend a single cent on paid advertising not one
cent because i had the audience yeah that's great i think it was
similar for us when we first launched our youtuber academy i just
tweeted something about it i didn't even mention it on youtube for the
first two cohorts i just tweeted it and we had an avalanche of people
being like oh my god this sounds great i want to sign up where do i
sign up we had a few people joking oh just take my money now lol that
kind of thing and i think that's what happens when you've just spent
so long jabbing ie providing so much value completely for free over
such a long period of time that when you do want to sell a product and
you kind of a little bit tapped in into what the audience wants it
just basically sells itself one of the things i would add here and
this goes back to that conference metaphor is when do you know that
it's the time and i would say people will start asking you yeah and
you don't want to be too pushy i was at a hotel last week and this guy
comes up to me and he just starts talking to me and within 20 seconds
he's given me his business card what do i think i think this guy has
no value to provide he is not going to be a trustworthy person and so
i just left the business card on the table i'm not going to contact
that guy but if we had had a conversation and he had said hey you know
this these are my thoughts on this and that i said hey that's pretty
interesting then i would have said do you have a business card and so
you want to get to a place where you're providing enough value to
people that they're asking you and once you're getting enough people
asking that's when you know it's time to monetize and there's this
really good book uh the minimalist entrepreneur by our mutual friend
lavinia i think um where he kind of talks about this method of
monetizing as being like about building an audience first and then
building a product that will suit that audience whereas normally the
way we think about it intuitively is oh let's build the thing first
and then i will find people to buy my thing whereas if you start off
by just providing loads of value doing it on public platforms like
twitter and youtube transitioning them to your mailing list doing a
bit of strategy just really focusing on being as helpful as you
possibly can for free to thousands hundreds of thousands millions of
people on the internet then when you create a product you will know
exactly what they want they will tell you what they want they will be
asking you for the product and then you can make it and then the
audience is already primed to buy from you if that's what you want to
go i'm trying to sort of summarize all this and so i would say it's
this get started by sharing ideas and as you do you will learn about
whatever it is that you're writing about position yourself as an
expert and then because you position yourself as an expert when people
come to your stuff ask them to sign up for your email list ask them to
keep reading your stuff and as they do certain people who see you as
an expert will say hey i would like to learn this this this and that
from you once they say that start writing about those ideas eventually
they'll say i'd also like to pay you for your help and that's when you
begin to have a product but one of the other things that you see
sometimes is as you work on something you just see a big hole in the
market so the carlson brothers when they were founding stripe they saw
wait this is weird it's really hard to accept payments sahil who
started gumroad felt the same sort of thing he's like this business
doesn't exist and he was his own first customer and so as you create
you're going to see opportunities that emerge and once that happens
you can start monetizing but what's so great about having an audience
is at the beginning you don't need to go out and raise funding you
have way less risk because you have people who already trust you and
they're going to give you the benefit of the doubt if and when your
first product isn't quite up to par so i guess like now both you and i
are sitting here kind of with fairly profitable multi-million dollar
businesses where we teach stuff where we've got teams of people like
five years ago there's no way in hell you and i would have imagined
that we're we're going to be sitting here and talking about this right
now but it was really a case of just you know like 99.99 of all the
stuff that we do is completely free we don't charge a penny for it
it's just that we focus on providing as much value to the audience as
much as we can adding adding a healthy dose of strategizing and
improving and stuff over time such that when we get to the point of
being able to monetize we then get to this point of having having
these successful businesses and one of the things that i would
emphasize is you were up at nights editing videos you insisted on
publishing regularly i used to insist on writing for 90 minutes every
single day and for something like five years i publish something
basically every single day whether that was a tweet or an article i've
been doing newsletters and i haven't missed the newsletter in a couple
years now that isn't to say that this is impossible because you know
we've we've been able to do it but it requires a certain amount of
discipline and consistency but what i will say with that is having
multi-million dollar businesses that we can run from anywhere in the
world and having the freedom to explore ideas for a living is the gift
that makes that hard work worth doing yeah i think that's fantastic
stuff and i think like often often people ask me like how how did you
sustain the motivation and the momentum to keep on pushing out those
videos even when you didn't have an audience and even when you weren't
making any money and the thing i always come back to is that it just
it was fun like when you find something that you're doing for the
intrinsic joy of doing it and you find ways to make it fun like trying
to get a little bit better trying to incorporate these editing tricks
trying to be like oh how can i speak on camera a bit differently next
time what elements of peter mckinnon or matt deville can incorporate
into my videos that's all the stuff that makes it super fun and so
after work when i'd be sitting on my computer editing and my housemate
would be like why do you work all the time to me it would just seem a
little bit of an unusual question because when you just enjoy that
thing so much it really genuinely doesn't feel like work yes there are
aspects of it that do and sometimes you do have to grind through the
boredom of it but for the most part the more you can enjoy the thing
for its own sake rather than once i become a millionaire then i'll
have fun the more you can enjoy intrinsically for the joy of the
activity itself the more the easier it is to sustain this habit over
time and to enjoy the journey along the way so i think that's a good
place to end this david thank you so much for joining uh if you guys
