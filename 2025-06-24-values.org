```
Last question Drew What did you learn prepping 
for this episode and recording it yeah Yeah So I  

think one of the big takeaway the self-awareness 
thing really it was a big one for me I I have an  

I have had an idea of my values for a while 
and there is every few years I kind of like  

sit down and I'm like "Okay what is you know 
the value shift or whatever." What surprised  

me is how much my values have shifted over time 
honestly So going from some of these lower values  

you know when you're a little bit younger um you 
prioritize different things and as you age all of  

those things it becomes apparent that they're not 
important Yeah You know having fun and excitement  

and novelty and all of that going to just simpler 
values or maybe more the higher values really that  

was big for me So this the self-awareness piece 
around this I don't think it can be understated  

I really do think that if you are just aware and 
cleareyed about your values that's not the fix  

It's not going to change so much But especially 
for people who just haven't done this before Yeah  

It's a clarifying It's so clarifying and it can 
direct so many of your decisions going forward  

and you just understand like the you understand 
why you feel so bad about certain things Like I  

said I've I've just been able to accept that oh 
I'm just going to feel bad about this sometimes  

and that's okay And it's a side effect of you 
caring about it Yeah Exactly Exactly It's like "Oh  

this is actually a good sign right that I'm Yeah 
that I'm feeling bad about this because I value  

this relationship so much or this this value in my 
life." Yeah Yeah That's So I think self-awareness  

um I I I hesitate to like put that one up front 
because it I it's not the whole picture It's not  

the the fix all for everything but it will get 
you a long long way Yeah Um so right off the bat  

yeah the the self-awareness around my values and 
how much they've changed that was a big that was  

a big one for me Priority Priorities too Um I 
knew benevolence was pretty high in mine but I  

just didn't realize how just how central it was 
and just how much it butts up against the other  

values that I have too and trying to rec reconcile 
those Yeah So for me you know as you know I've  

been writing about values for like 10 plus years 
For me the I think the biggest the biggest aha  

uh prepping for this episode was really getting 
that broader understanding of like I guess the  

kind of the network of values like how values kind 
of interlace with one another And I guess the the  

potential danger of overindexing on one single 
value because I I I think my approach through  

most of my career was very much it was a little 
simplistic It was like find the thing that you  

care most about and go all in on it And I think 
on a surface level I think that's a good advice  

I I certainly think that's way better than just 
not knowing what you value at all So like if you  

take somebody who has no idea what their values 
are and are like feel pulled in 20 different  

directions and you tell them to like find the one 
thing and go all in on it I think that's going to  

be a significant improvement I think going back 
and and prepping for this episode and doing a  

bunch of the research and especially reading 
some of the the older philosophy around this  

like it really gave me an appreciation of of that 
actually going all in on one thing for too long  

uh can be problematic And it was interesting 
because it actually caused me to look at some  

of the decisions I've made uh over the last 10 or 
15 years Like I definitely think that's an issue I  

have I have a tendency to go all in on one thing 
and there are a lot of benefits to that You you  

whatever that thing is it tends you get very very 
good at it and you get outsides benefits but it  

definitely harms other areas of your life So like 
I I've I've probably I've spent most of my life  

being a pretty unbalanced person in that sense 
Like I'm just like very overindexed on one thing  

So yeah for me it was gaining the understanding 
of like of like hey you you need to have a a small  

diversity of values You know it's probably optimal 
to have three or four things that you're all in  

on quote unquote that can harmonize together and 
counterbalance each other and rest on each other  

And that way you're a little diversified 
like kind of like a stock portfolio like  

you know if if one thing that you care about just 
suddenly goes south terribly you have a few other  

things to fall back on you're not putting all your 
self-esteem or self-worth in like a single basket  

Uh so so that was the biggest thing for me 
and then you know kind of that rediscovery  

uh of talked about in Plato's Republic of just 
kind of like the you know the individual is the  

social and vice versa like how that plays out on a 
social level as well like you don't want a society  

that's all in on one thing because you're going 
to pay the price for that you you really do want  

a a society that has a diversity of values and um 
and those values can harmonize and but also be in  

tension with each other and and also just the 
fact that some of that tension is is a feature  

It's not a bug It's that that tension is evidence 
that it matters and you're you you're care about  

it and you're taking care of it Yeah Yeah Yeah And 
along those lines too I guess another realization  

I had was um when you are in tension with other 
people's values or whatever it is if make sure  

you're talking on the same level right like 
are you having an intellect in intellectual  

conversation or is it actually about values or is 
one of you uh like on the intellectual level and  

the other one is talking on values like and I I 
feel like I've been pretty good about this most  

of the time but like um allowing people to kind of 
just have their own values and like be okay with  

it and not judging them for that A lot of times we 
just oh this person's stupid because of whatever  

view they hold or or thing they're doing or value 
they hold and it's really just comes down to they  

just have a different set of values So like you 
know the whole Jonathan height thing the moral  

foundations theory knowing that we all value 
kind of the same things but just in different  

proportions right that was a real that's if you 
need a more intellectual framework for that to  

like understand other people and their values 
that was that was helpful for me anyway Yeah  

And I like thinking of it in those terms as 
well because I I do think there is a tendency  

especially in like political conflicts like to 
to have this assumption that there are right  

and wrong values that there are there are certain 
values that like you should have or shouldn't have  

I like the understanding that most values 
are shared by everybody What changes is the  

proportionality and the emphasis Yeah Right 
And so when you look at maybe say tension  

between different cultures or different 
places on the political spectrum it's not  

that they value different things it's that they 
prioritize different things right and this this  

group of people over here sees you know harm 
and care as more important than say fairness  

And this group over here sees fairness and freedom 
as more important than harm and care So it's just  

that they have a different hierarchy and it's 
playing out in across the political world Right  

Right And it's it's the elephant Right Yeah It's 
an emotional tug It's an emotional world that  

you're dealing with And so you know when when 
you are trying to reason with people you need  

to speak to their values too And even if you're 
going to agree to disagree you need to understand  

someone on the the level of their values Yeah Yeah 
All right I'm excited because I'm gonna get the  

[ __ ] out of this blazer I'm never going to do 
this again Lesson learned Lesson learned Enjoy it  

audience while you have it Any epiphanies change 
behaviors anything you're going to go home and do  

differently next week or are you just going to 
sleep because you're tired i I mean the sleep  

I do need to value some sleep I think after this 
But um no I I mean like I was saying I knew that  

benevolence was like a core value of mine I just 
uh I didn't realize just how core it was and and  

how many times it bumps up against the others 
So I've really been thinking on that lately and  

I'm going to continue to think on that Yeah Cool 
Well if listeners of the show if you want to think  

on these things as well discover your own values 
spend the entire month working through everything  

that we've been talking about piece by piece 
exercise by exercise Then we have a 30-day values  

track in the momentum community Ultimately what 
momentum is about is the idea that it's a series  

of small changes in your life that create momentum 
that get you pointed in the right direction  

And the reason we're building a community around 
this is because ultimately taking action is about  

accountability So if you want to check that out if 
you want to implement everything you've heard in  

this episode if you're still [ __ ] if anybody's 
listening still if you're still here I assume you  

care enough to to want to implement this into your 
life So if you if you want a framework and a and a  

guide to help you implement it into your life and 
then you also want the accountability on the back  

end to make sure you're actually doing it check 
out findmomentum.com/values All the information  

is there And like I said we're going to do this 
for every single episode every month That's right  

And so it it doesn't end with values When we do 
procrastination next month we're going to have a  

30-day track for procrastination Help you solve 
procrastination in your life And then when we do  

the episode after that same thing on and on and on

* How to Find and Live by Your Values

* What are Values?

** Characteristics of Values
** Defining Values

  Let's get into the nitty-gritty a little bit. What is a value? How
  do we define these things? What do they look like? How are they
  different?

  Modern value theory within psychology has been significantly shaped by
  the work of Israeli researcher /Scholom Schwarz/. He's considered the
  godfather of this field. Schwarz defined values as

#+begin_quote
"beliefs about trans-situational goals varying in importance, which
serve as guiding principles in the life of a person or a group."
#+end_quote

This definition might sound complex, so let's break it down.

** Key Characteristics of Values


1. Linked with Emotion

   Values are inherently emotional. By definition, they are considered
   the most important things in life. Consider, for example, the
   emotions displayed by protesters or the intense anger felt when
   someone wrongs you — these reactions are tied to your values being
   challenged.

2. Motivate Action

   Values not only define what you want to pursue in life, but they
   also fuel the energy behind those pursuits. For instance, if you
   value status, it will not only guide your goals but also energize
   your actions and excitement about opportunities.

3. Apply Across Contexts

   Values maintain their importance across different contexts. If you
   value honesty, it should hold true at work, in relationships, and
   with family. There's no context where you disregard your value if
   it’s truly a value.

4. Standards for Moral Judgments

   Values serve as standards by which we make moral judgments, both of
   ourselves and others. For example, if personal freedom is a value,
   you measure yourself and others against this benchmark.

5. Ranked Hierarchically

   People have a hierarchy of values that define their identities and
   guide their decisions. This hierarchy prioritizes what is most
   important to each individual.

6. Involve Trade-Offs

   Prioritizing one value often requires devaluing others. For
   example, if you highly value personal freedom, you might place less
   importance on stability or routine, seeing them as constraints.
  
** Core Questions Values Address

Values answer the fundamental questions of life: What matters? What is
worth pursuing? What kind of person do I want to become? These are
deep philosophical questions that define the essence of who you are.





** Values vs. Psychological Needs vs. Preferences

*** Understanding Psychological Needs vs. Values

Let's clarify the differences between psychological needs and values
as we move forward. Psychological needs are universal — we all have
them in varying proportions. These needs are survival-based, such as
the need for food. Without these needs being met, like food, survival
becomes impossible, and there's no room for negotiation on this.

Similarly, there are certain fundamental psychological needs, such as
social connection and belonging, that everyone requires. While the
basic needs are the same for everyone, the strategies to meet them can
vary vastly.

Values, as explained by Scholom Schwarz, serve as strategies to
fulfill our psychological needs. For instance, while fulfilling the
need for connection and belonging, some may lean towards values of
benevolence and generosity, while others may focus on loyalty or group
affiliation.

*** Differences Between Values and Preferences

Preferences differ fundamentally from values and psychological
needs. Preferences are simple tastes or choices between non-impactful
options, lacking deep emotional connection or identity reflection. For
example, preferring steak over chicken does not constitute a value;
it's merely a taste preference that holds no significant emotional
weight or purpose.

*** Emotional Connection and Flexibility of Values

Values are tightly linked to emotions, changing throughout life based
on experiences. They aren't static; they evolve as life's
circumstances and personal insights shift. This changeability
distinguishes them from the permanence of psychological needs.

It's crucial to recognize that values are not easily altered through
logic or reasoning; they're deeply tied to emotional experiences and
strategies developed during one's life and influenced by the
surrounding culture and environment.

*** Empathy and Emotional Sensitivity in Values

Understanding values can enhance empathy. Recognizing that someone's
differing values are their strategies for meeting their needs can
reduce judgment. Values provoke strong emotions, be it in passion or
discomfort, especially when questioned or challenged.

In this episode, the deep exploration of values might evoke such
emotions, stirring reflection or even discomfort in the listener. This
isn't a straightforward topic; it's central to personal identity and
emotional well-being.

*** Values as a Potentially Unsettling Topic

Questioning one's values can be one of the most challenging yet
enlightening psychological tasks. It's common for conflicts between
values to arise in life, often addressed in the realm of therapy to
navigate such complexities.

*** Sum Them Up

Finally, how these ideas affect your need for belonging or
connection—factors like perceived security or need for novelty—vary
individually. Each person’s psychological makeup determines their
unique blend of needs and the values developed as strategies to meet
them.





** Schwartz's Values Wheel

*** Introduction to Schwartz's Values Wheel

We're going to explore multiple frameworks to help clarify the
abstract nature of values. Understanding these should give you clarity
on personal preferences and life challenges. We'll start with
Schwartz's Values Wheel, which was developed through extensive
cross-cultural surveys across more than 70 countries. This wheel
defines ten core universal human values. We all possess these values,
though in varying proportions, which influence our individual
identities.

*** The Ten Core Values

1. Self-Enhancement Values:
   - Achievement: The drive for success and mastery.
   - Power: The desire for control and influence.

2. Conservation Values:
   - Tradition: Respect for customs and cultural heritage.
   - Security: The need for safety and stability.
   - Conformity: Adhering to social norms and rules.

3. Self-Transcendence Values:
   - Universalism: A sense of unity with all people and the earth.
   - Benevolence: The pursuit of altruism, charity, and kindness.

4. Openness to Change Values:
   - Stimulation: The seeking of excitement and novelty.
   - Self-Direction: Personal freedom and independence.

5. Hedonism:
   - The pursuit of pleasure and enjoyment for its own sake.


#+CAPTION: Schwartz Model
#+ATTR_HTML: :title Schwartz Wheel :align center
[[https://0--key.github.io/assets/img/values/Schwartz-Model.png]]

*** The Wheel Structure and Internal Tensions

Schwartz placed these values in a wheel because of the inherent
tensions between different value groups. Opposite groups on the wheel
often have conflicting drives. For instance, values of "Openness to
Change" conflict with "Conservation" values. Imagine individuals
passionate about personal freedom; they are usually more open to
change and exploration, often at odds with those who adhere strictly
to tradition and security.

Another example of internal tension within the wheel is between the
values of "Self-Transcendence" and "Self-Enhancement". While
"Self-Transcendence" values emphasize group orientation and
selflessness, "Self-Enhancement" values focus on personal achievement
and power.

*** Synergy Among Neighboring Values

Values positioned next to each other on the wheel often harmonize
well, such as "Universalism" and "Benevolence", or "Self-Direction"
and "Stimulation". These adjacent values support one another, offering
complementary pathways for personal development.

*** Political Compass Parallel

Interestingly, the dimensions of the Values Wheel parallel frameworks
used in political science, notably the political compass, which
evaluates political beliefs along similar axes. These parallels
suggest that fundamental human value tensions are mirrored in larger
societal and political structures.

*** Understanding and Navigating Internal Conflicts

Awareness of these internal tensions helps normalize personal
conflicts we face. Recognizing which values are in conflict can help
individuals understand difficulties they might experience, such as
anxiety or sacrifice, in their pursuit of what they hold dear.

When faced with challenging decisions, consider which values each
option represents and which values you are willing to compromise. This
reflection can provide clarity and help accept past choices,
understanding that sacrifices were made in favor of deeply held
values.

** Instrumental and Terminal Values

*** Introduction to Instrumental and Terminal Values

The second framework we're exploring is proposed by researcher Milton
Rokeach from the 1970s. This framework distinguishes between two types
of values: instrumental and terminal. Understanding this distinction
offers clarity on our motivations and how we pursue goals in life.

*** Terminal Values

Terminal values are the end goals or ultimate values that you pursue
for their own sake. They are considered terminal because they
represent the ultimate objectives, with nothing beyond them. They are
inherently valued without serving as a means to something else. These
values are unconditional and intrinsic to our sense of purpose and
fulfillment.

*** Instrumental Values

Instrumental values, on the other hand, are more means-to-an-end; they
are valued because they lead you towards achieving a terminal
value. They are steps or methods that guide you towards fulfilling
your ultimate values. Although important, instrumental values gain
significance primarily through their connection to terminal values.

*** Importance of Distinction

This differentiation is crucial, as people often confuse instrumental
values for terminal ones. Such confusion can lead to misalignment in
life choices and dissatisfaction. For example, making money might be
perceived as an ultimate goal. Without linking it to a terminal
value—like providing security for one's family—it can leave someone
feeling unfulfilled and unsure of their purpose.

When individuals have clarity about their terminal values, they can
find meaning in various roles and jobs, seeing them as instrumental in
serving the larger purpose of their lives. Whether it’s working
towards family security or personal growth, understanding the
relationship between instrumental and terminal values can redefine how
we perceive and engage with our daily endeavors.

** Hierarchy of Values

*** Understanding the Hierarchy

This framework introduces the concept that our values exist within a
hierarchy, with some being more foundational than others. At the top
are our most important, guiding values, and beneath them are values
adopted primarily to support these higher priorities. This hierarchy
suggests that while certain values might appear essential, they often
serve deeper, more meaningful objectives.

*** Navigating Value Tensions

Within the hierarchy, tensions often arise as we try to balance and
prioritize values. Take, for example, achievement and
benevolence. These values can sometimes conflict—prioritizing personal
success may detract from helping others, and vice versa. However,
achieving a balance where success enables more benevolent acts
illustrates the dynamic nature of value hierarchies.

*** Flexibility Across Contexts

While inherent, these values need not be rigidly applied across all
aspects of life. Depending on the context, certain values might take
precedence. For instance, benevolence may be the focal value in
personal relationships, while achievement might be emphasized in
professional settings. Recognizing this flexibility can prevent the
application of inappropriate values in unsuitable contexts.

*** Personal Reflections on Values

Personal experiences and self-reflection can bring insight into one's
value hierarchy. Engaging with tools like the Schwartz Value Survey,
individuals can gain clarity on which values resonate at the core
level versus those adopted for instrumental purposes. This
understanding reveals how value changes impact life direction,
relationships, and priorities over time.

*** Evolution of Values Over Time

The dynamic nature of values means they evolve with life’s
progression. What was once a core value might shift in significance,
influencing daily habits, friendships, and personal pursuits. This
evolution highlights the adaptability and ongoing development in one's
value system, guiding decisions and life choices as circumstances
change.

*** Discussion and Examples

Reflections on value assessments reveal common values such as
self-direction and achievement, while others like hedonism may take a
lower priority despite a lifestyle rich in stimulation. The conscious
adaptation of values over time showcases the individual journey each
person undertakes to better align their actions with their changing
priorities and life stages.

** Values Conflict

*** Introduction to Values Conflict

Values conflict arises when our deeply held beliefs and priorities
come into competition, creating internal tension and challenging our
ability to make decisions. Understanding and navigating these
conflicts is a critical aspect of personal development, as our values
cannot all be optimized simultaneously.

*** Examples of Values Conflict

- For someone who has benevolence as a high value, like wanting to
  help others, this can cause tension with personal goals such as
  achievement or self-care. Such individuals might struggle with
  saying "no," leading to overcommitment and burnout. As
  responsibilities grow, prioritizing certain aspects over others can
  compound the tension.

- In another example, personal values like self-direction and
  achievement might overshadow social connections and community
  involvement. While professional success might fulfill the desire to
  help others indirectly through work, it often leaves personal
  relationships sidelined, leading to sacrifices that can feel like
  sacrificing one value for the sake of another.

*** The Role of Trade-offs and Prioritization

Schwartz's Values Wheel highlights that all values come with inherent
trade-offs. In real life, making choices about which value to
prioritize often means sacrificing another. This necessitates
difficult adult decisions, particularly when neither option is less
significant.

*** Navigating Internal Tension

Many individuals wrestle with values conflict, sometimes seeking
therapy for guidance. Common dilemmas involve balancing social justice
advocacy with academic achievement or managing professional
aspirations with personal relationships. These conflicts are
challenging because they involve elements you deeply care about, yet
they pull you in opposite directions.

*** Conclusion

Recognizing the trade-offs that come with value-based decisions helps
normalize these internal conflicts. It's essential to understand that
prioritizing values is a constant balancing act, where some degree of
sacrifice is inevitable. Through this awareness, individuals can make
more informed and peaceful decisions about where to direct their
energy and devotion.




** Carol Ryff's Six Dimensions of Psychological Well-being

*** Exploring Psychological Well-being

Carol Ryff's framework offers a comprehensive perspective on values by
identifying dimensions that contribute to psychological well-being and
human flourishing. This contrasts with other frameworks that often
focus on trade-offs between values. Ryff's dimensions aim to outline
what constitutes "good" values that promote overall health and
happiness.

*** The Six Dimensions

1. *Autonomy*: This involves being self-directed, resisting social
   pressures to conform, and acting based on personal values. High
   autonomy reflects not caring overly about external validation,
   while low autonomy reflects dependency on others' opinions.

2. *Environmental Mastery*: This dimension is about competence and
   effectively managing life's demands. Individuals scoring high here
   feel capable and resourceful in navigating their environment, while
   those with low scores feel powerless and out of control.

3. *Personal Growth*: Emphasizing lifelong learning and openness to
   new experiences, individuals high in personal growth constantly
   seek self-awareness and improvement. Low scores indicate a lack of
   interest in learning or evolving over time.

4. *Positive Relations with Others*: This dimension focuses on the
   ability to form trusting, meaningful relationships where
   connections are valued for their own sake rather than being
   instrumental. Low scores can indicate feelings of isolation and
   difficulty in forming bonds.

5. *Purpose in Life*: Individuals high in this dimension possess
   clear goals and a strong sense of direction, finding meaning in
   past and present experiences. Low scores are often associated with
   a lack of direction and feeling aimless.

6. *Self-Acceptance*: This entails having a generally positive
   attitude toward oneself, owning one's flaws, and being
   realistic. High self-acceptance includes self-forgiveness without
   delusion, while low levels lead to self-criticism and
   dissatisfaction.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Ryffs-6-factor-well-being :align center
[[https://0--key.github.io/assets/img/values/Ryffs-6-factor-well-being.png]]

*** Integrating the Dimensions

Each dimension highlights values that contribute significantly to
overall well-being. Unlike Schwartz's framework, which often includes
inherent value trade-offs, Ryff's dimensions are seen as terminal
values worthwhile in their own right. They form the foundation of
human flourishing and are difficult to argue against as beneficial.

*** Application and Reflection

In practice, individuals may prioritize different dimensions according
to their personal value hierarchy. For example, one might prioritize
autonomy and personal growth, reflecting a focus on self-direction and
achievement. These dimensions correlate with broader psychological
frameworks and parallel concepts like a growth mindset and
self-efficacy.

*** Challenges of Self-Acceptance

Of the six dimensions, many people struggle most with self-acceptance,
as it involves facing one’s flaws and emotions honestly. It is
believed that difficulties in other areas, like autonomy or personal
growth, often have roots in a lack of self-acceptance. Recognizing and
working on this dimension can therefore positively influence overall
psychological well-being.

** Aristotle's Golden Mean as Virtue

*** Introducing Aristotle's Golden Mean

Aristotle, the granddaddy of virtue ethics, defined virtue as a
balance—a "golden mean" between two vices or extremes. Unlike modern
frameworks that often measure values as quantities, Aristotle's
approach emphasizes moderation. He suggested that every virtue stands
between two deficiencies, advocating for a balanced approach to life.

*** Examples of the Golden Mean

Aristotle's concept can be applied across various virtues:
- *Autonomy*: Too much leads to isolation, while too little results
  in dependence. The virtue lies in having just enough autonomy to be
  independent yet connected.
- *Courage*: At its extremes, courage becomes recklessness or
  cowardice. The virtue is found in being brave yet cautious.
- *Honesty*: Excessive honesty can be offensive, while too little
  honesty leads to deceit. The golden mean ensures truthfulness
  without unnecessary bluntness.
- *Generosity*: Over-generosity can cause wastefulness, while
  stinginess is the opposite vice. A balance allows for kindness
  without personal detriment.

*** Applying the Golden Mean to Values

This framework is particularly valuable in avoiding overcommitment to
a single value, which can lead to unintended negative consequences. A
balanced approach can also help manage the inherent tensions between
competing values. For example, the tension between generosity and
frugality can be navigated by recognizing virtue in both sides.

*** The Interconnectedness of Values

Values don't exist in isolation—they function as a network that
supports and enhances each other. For instance, courage without
purpose reduces its significance, and generosity needs a target for
its efforts to matter. Therefore, values gain meaning through their
interrelationships.

*** Wisdom and Balance

Aristotle emphasized wisdom as a critical virtue, as it encompasses
understanding and balancing other virtues. Wisdom helps detect when
values are out of alignment and guides readjusting them for personal
equilibrium.

*** The Individual Nature of Balance

Finding the right balance is a personal journey, depending on one's
personality, needs, and values. Each person's "balanced" state will
differ based on their unique preferences and priorities. Understanding
one's intrinsic needs and the dynamics of their value network is
crucial for achieving personal balance.

Ultimately, Aristotle’s Golden Mean encourages a harmonious existence
where values complement and correct one another, promoting a
well-rounded and fulfilling life.



* Values and Your Relationships

** A Case Study in Values Clash

This section explores how fundamental differences in values can
significantly impact relationships. A friend shared a story about his
relationship that highlights potential discord when partners have
opposing values. They had contrasting lifestyles—he preferred
intellectual, frugal, and relaxed experiences, while she leaned
towards luxury and traditional expectations of gender roles.

** The Importance of Aligning Values

Despite their mutual love for travel, their reasons for appreciating
it clashed deeply, which became apparent during their trip. Their
disagreements over spending and lifestyle preferences underscored that
their relationship's issues weren't just about different interests but
fundamental values. When core values such as financial perspectives
and lifestyle choices differ significantly, finding common ground
becomes challenging, if not impossible.

** Navigating the Complexity of Values in Relationships

The conflict in this example serves as a reminder that shared
interests do not always equate to shared values. Misalignments in
values like money management, religious views, and approach to life
can lead to conflict, which in turn affects relationship
stability. Successful relationships often flourish when there is a
complementary or supportive dynamic in values, allowing for balance
and mutual growth.

** Revealing Our Values Through Relationships

Relationships serve as a mirror, revealing our deepest values and
sometimes challenging us to reevaluate them. Partners can help
identify inconsistencies between stated values and actions, prompting
personal growth and introspection. Experiencing discomfort in a
relationship often highlights areas where values are misaligned or
where personal growth is needed.

** The Role of Communication and Self-awareness

To manage such conflicts, open and honest communication is vital,
allowing partners to express their underlying motivations and
needs. However, both parties must possess the self-awareness to
understand their values and the maturity to communicate them
effectively. Relationships can test our deeply held beliefs,
assumptions, and motivations, guiding us towards personal clarity and
growth.

** Compatibility and Future Outlook

Imagining a future with a partner requires aligned goals and
compatible values. When partners envision incompatible futures,
staying together becomes difficult. Relationships force us to confront
what we care about and what we prioritize in life, underscoring the
importance of aligning values with personal and shared life goals.


** The Clash of Values in Relationships

*** Understanding Value Clashes

Misalignment in values often becomes a critical point of tension in
relationships. It's not unusual for partners to mistake differences in
interests or preferences for value clashes. However, true value
differences—rooted in fundamental beliefs and priorities—pose greater
challenges and require deeper understanding and navigation.

*** Personal Growth in Navigating Values

As one matures, understanding and respect for differing values can
improve. Early on, there might be a tendency to prioritize personal
values, such as autonomy and independence, potentially at the expense
of the relationship. Recognizing and respecting your partner's values
can lead to more harmonious relationships. Sometimes, stepping back to
understand motivations behind behaviors can shed light on these values
and foster more empathetic interactions.

*** Compromise and Relationships

Long-term relationships require compromises. However, constant
compromise to the detriment of personal values can lead to a loss of
identity and dissatisfaction. Finding a balance where stable and
healthy relationships coexist with personal values is
essential. Sometimes, it involves turning down the intensity of
certain values to give room for others that sustain the relationship.

*** Changing Values Over Time

Our values and priorities often evolve with experience. For example,
the appeal of novelty and excitement in a relationship might initially
be strong, but over time, stability and consistency become more
valued. Recognizing this shift and adapting your value system is
integral to sustaining long-term relationships. Both partners in a
relationship must adapt and acknowledge these evolving values for
continued harmony.

*** Relationship and Value Hierarchy

Interestingly, placing a relationship at the pinnacle of our value
hierarchy can undermine it. When a person becomes too focused on the
relationship, they might overcompromise, eroding their own identity
and the authenticity of the relationship itself. Maintaining
individuality within a relationship preserves the core traits that
initially attracted partners to each other, contributing to ongoing
intimacy and connection.

In conclusion, understanding and navigating value differences, making
strategic compromises, and allowing for the natural evolution of
values are crucial for healthy relationships. Avoiding the trap of
over-prioritizing the relationship itself ensures a balance that
fosters both personal growth and shared happiness.


** Identifying and Navigating Values in Relationships

*** Advice for Recognizing Values

When entering a new relationship, it's crucial to differentiate
between shared interests and core values. Interests are the activities
and preferences that may initially bring people together, but it's the
underlying values that ultimately determine compatibility. Observing
signals early on, like expensive tastes or lifestyle choices, offers
insights into a person's values.

*** Early Conversations About Values

To avoid unforeseen conflicts, prioritize discussing values early in
the relationship. Within the first few dates, aim to delve into topics
like attitudes toward money, motivations, religious beliefs, family
outlook, and future aspirations. These discussions help determine if
your core values align, potentially saving both parties from future
heartbreak.

*** The Role of Respect in Values

Even if partners don't share identical values, mutual respect for each
other's values is essential. Open, honest conversations about
differing values can lead to a mutual understanding and respect,
fostering a healthy relationship. Disrespect or dismissal of a
partner's values often leads to a breakdown in communication and
willingness to compromise.

*** Filtering for Compatibility

Filter for compatibility by asking questions that reveal what truly
matters to both partners. While it's important to approach these
discussions appropriately, understanding motivations behind interests
provides a clearer picture of whether you're likely to find long-term
compatibility.

*** Building a Foundation on Respected Values

Ultimately, the success of any relationship is more about the degree
to which partners can respect each other's values than about sharing
the exact same ones. Respecting a partner's values enables healthy
compromise and growth, making this foundational to navigating values
within any relationship.

** Understanding Compatibility Through Values

*** Tools for Exploring Compatibility

Using tools like decks of cards with value-based questions can be a
fun and insightful way to assess compatibility in relationships. Such
tools are designed to prompt discussions that reveal core values and
preferences, helping couples determine their compatibility. Engaging
with these questions can fast-track understanding and highlight
potential areas of alignment or divergence early in the relationship.

*** The Role of Familiarity in Long-term Relationships

Over time, couples who have been together for many years, like the
speaker and his wife, often develop a deep understanding of each
other's values. This familiarity creates a sense of stability and
comfort that enhances the relationship. Even if partners don't share
all the same values initially, adapting and balancing each other's
values over time contributes to a profound connection and security
that is unique to long-term partnerships.

*** Adaptation and Balance

As relationships progress and partners adapt to each other's values,
they often reach a point where their differences are not obstacles but
sources of balance and strength. This adaptation process can lead to
significant relationship stability, providing a foundation that allows
partners to thrive both individually and as a couple. The experience
of seamlessly understanding each other's needs and preferences,
highlighted by activities like the Newlywed Game, reflects the depth
of connection that emerges from shared life experiences.

*** Long-term Fulfillment

The profound feelings of security and gratification that come from
such balanced relationships offer a unique fulfillment. This dynamic
underscores the importance of compatibility through values, showing
that when couples effectively navigate and integrate their values,
they can enjoy a partnership that not only survives but thrives over
time.




* Where Do Values Come From?

In this chapter, we'll briefly explore the origins of values. It's a
fascinating topic with a rich research background, and while it's easy
to get immersed in the details, we'll aim to provide an overview
before moving on to practical advice.

Historically, the concept that values can significantly differ among
individuals and cultures is relatively modern. During the colonial
period, there was a dominant, non-pluralistic view, primarily led by
Europeans who often imposed their values on others, dismissing the
local beliefs as inferior or "savage."

It wasn't until the 20th century that a broader recognition and
acceptance of value diversity began to emerge, acknowledging the wide
range of values shaped by different cultures and experiences. This
shift has provided a deeper understanding of human values and the
complex factors that influence them.


** Margaret Mead's Cultural Relativism

Margaret Mead, a pioneering anthropologist in the 1920s, challenged
traditional Western views on cultural norms through her research on
Samoan society. During a time when few female academics existed and
travel to remote cultures was uncommon, Mead went to a Samoan village
to study the local tribe's cultural values and behaviors.

Upon observation, she noted surprising differences: Samoan teenagers
appeared less inhibited and happier compared to their European and
North American counterparts. They exhibited greater sexual openness
without judgment or social stigma, a stark contrast to the
conservative and restrained Western values of the time.

Her findings suggested that many values perceived as inherent in
Western society were actually culturally relative. This idea—that
values vary across cultures—sparked significant controversy, as it
challenged the prevailing belief in a universal set of Western norms
and values.

To support her theory, Mead conducted further studies in New Guinea,
observing three tribes with vastly different values and social
structures. These findings reinforced her argument that values are
largely shaped by cultural surroundings and are not absolute.

Mead's work prompts an awareness of how many of our values are
inherited from our environment—be it family, community, or
culture—rather than consciously chosen. Understanding this distinction
between inherited and chosen values is essential for personal growth
and self-awareness.

For individuals, travel and exposure to diverse cultures can reveal
which values are flexible and which are non-negotiable. This exposure
helps distinguish between values we've adopted because of our
upbringing and those we actively choose to uphold. The journey of
recognizing and questioning these values can lead to greater
understanding and adaptation, highlighting the diverse ways societies
organize and define what is important.

** Mary Douglas's Grid-Group Framework

Building on the work of Margaret Mead, Mary Douglas introduced the
Grid-Group Framework to map out cultural values and categorize
different societies. Her framework consists of two dimensions: "grid"
and "group."

*** High-Grid vs. Low-Grid Cultures
- *High-Grid Cultures*: Emphasize strict rules and a hierarchical
  respect for authority. These societies prioritize order and
  structure.
- *Low-Grid Cultures*: Rely more on individual freedom and
  independence, often exhibiting a more libertarian spirit with less
  rigid constraints.


*In the same time:*

- *High-Group Cultures*: These are collectivist societies that
  prioritize communal goals over individual desires. The individual's
  interests are often aligned with the group's well-being.
- *Low-Group Cultures*: Characterized by individualism, where
  personal goals and achievements are prioritized over group cohesion.

Douglas's framework closely parallels other models discussed in this
episode, such as the political compass and Schwartz's values of
self-transcendence versus self-enhancement. These inherent
tensions—between order and freedom, collectivism and
individualism—recur across various contexts, demonstrating similar
patterns in both individual and societal values.

*** Cultural Values and Trade-offs

Mary Douglas emphasized that cultural values result from specific
societal choices, reflecting preferences and trade-offs that form
societal norms and taboos. Just as individuals grapple with balancing
their values, societies must navigate trade-offs among collective
values to maintain balance.

*** Challenges of Cultural Relativism

Cultural relativism, as presented by Mead, argues against absolute
right or wrong, seeing morality as culture-dependent. However, it can
become contentious when addressing extreme practices like slavery or
human sacrifices. These extremes highlight the risk of overemphasizing
a single value, leading to neglect or harm to other important values.

Aristotle's concept of the golden mean is applicable here, suggesting
that a balanced approach—neither excessive nor deficient—is essential
for morality. This balance applies to societal values as well, where
extremes on any axis can harm the broader value network.

*** Interdependencies and Challenges

Societies, like individuals, navigate their own complex value
networks, where overt focus on one value, such as family in some Latin
American and Asian cultures, can lead to systemic issues like
corruption. This example illustrates how cultural values must be
balanced to avoid adverse outcomes.

Douglas's framework underscores that values are deeply embedded in our
social and cultural environments. While many values are inherited,
they are also shaped by the social structures and institutions
surrounding us. This understanding highlights the intricate balance
between nature and nurture in value formation and the potential for
societal change.

** Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory

Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory offers a perspective on the
innate components influencing our values and moral judgments. Haidt
suggests that just as we have taste buds for different flavors, our
moral frameworks are shaped by foundational "moral taste buds" that
guide our perceptions of right and wrong.

*** The Six Moral Foundations

Haidt identifies at least six primary moral foundations:

1. *Care vs. Harm*: Focus on nurturing and protecting others.
2. *Fairness vs. Cheating*: Concerned with justice, rights, and
   equality.
3. *Loyalty vs. Betrayal*: Valuing allegiance to one's group or
   community.
4. *Authority vs. Subversion*: Preference for order and respect for
   tradition.
5. *Sanctity vs. Degradation*: Emphasizing purity and sacredness.
6. *Liberty vs. Oppression*: The desire for freedom from control and
   domination.

These foundations are thought to have evolved to help humans live in
cooperative groups. Each individual possesses all these moral taste
buds, but cultural and individual differences influence which ones are
prioritized.

*** Interplay Between Genetics and Culture

While cultural environments strongly influence which moral values are
emphasized, there is likely a genetic basis to these
predispositions. For instance, liberals typically prioritize the care
and fairness foundations, while conservatives utilize a broader
spectrum, including loyalty, authority, and sanctity.

*** Emotions as Drivers of Moral Values

Haidt emphasizes that moral values are deeply rooted in emotional
responses. His analogy of the "elephant and the rider" illustrates
that our emotional instincts (the elephant) often guide our behavior,
while our rational mind (the rider) post-hoc justifies these
actions. Rarely do logical arguments shift core values; instead,
values are fundamentally emotional.

*** Different Conceptions of Fairness

Liberal and conservative perspectives on fairness reflect fundamental
differences. Liberals often see fairness as equality or equity,
ensuring everyone has similar opportunities, while conservatives view
fairness as proportionality, rewarding individual contribution.

*** Societal Balancing Act

Haidt's theory aligns with Aristotle's golden mean concept,
reinforcing the idea that a balanced set of values is essential for
both individuals and societies. Extremes in any direction have
drawbacks, and historical events illustrate how overemphasis on
particular values can lead to societal imbalance and necessary
corrections.

The intertwining of individual morals with societal values reveals an
intricate web of interaction, suggesting that a healthy balance of
these moral foundations is crucial for collective well-being.

** The Allegory of the Taco Truck

This story, set at a taco truck, serves as an illustrative metaphor
for how different value systems come into play in everyday situations,
revealing the complex nature of human interactions.

*** The Incident

The narrator recounts an incident where he, his girlfriend, and
another patron at a taco truck experienced a conflict rooted in
differing value priorities. While sitting at the picnic table, they
observed a man reaching into the tip jar, presumably to reclaim a tip
for bus fare. A bystander, unaware of the man's mental disabilities,
perceived this as theft, resulting in a heated exchange.

*** Conflicting Values at Play

1. *Care and Harm*: The narrator, having interacted with the man and
   understood his situation, responded based on the value of care,
   feeling a protective empathy toward him.

2. *Fairness and Cheating*: The bystander was driven by a sense of
   fairness, perceiving the act as cheating and reacting based on the
   violation of that principle.

3. *Order and Calm*: The narrator's girlfriend sought to maintain
   peace and order, driven by her value for calm and stability, which
   had been disrupted by the escalating tension.

*** Reflections on the Event

From a detached perspective, the narrator later realized that each
person acted according to their values, none of which were inherently
wrong. Instead, it was a situation where different moral foundations
were triggered, leading to the conflict. This reflection emphasizes
how values can drive behavior and interpretations in ways that are
deeply personal yet universally relatable.

*** Microcosm of Broader Conflicts

Such situations frequently occur in daily life, where individuals may
clash not because their viewpoints are fundamentally incorrect, but
because their underlying values differ. This recognition can lead to
more understanding interactions, as it shows that apparent conflicts
often stem from diverse value systems rather than objective right or
wrong.

The "Allegory of the Taco Truck" thus serves as a reminder of how
complex and situational values can be, mirroring larger societal and
political divisions on a smaller scale. Understanding this can foster
empathy and temper reactions in the heat of the moment.

* Identifying Your Core Values

As we transition into this chapter, we're moving from theory and
discussion into practical application. So far, we've explored what
values are, their significance, their origins, and the ways they
manifest in our lives. Now, it's time to delve into a more personal
exploration: identifying your core values.

This section will guide you in determining what truly matters to you
by exploring exercises and methods designed to bring clarity to this
sometimes ambiguous aspect of personal identity. Recognizing your core
values can be challenging, given their often elusive nature and the
layers of influence from various life experiences.

We'll provide practical exercises to help unearth these foundational
elements of who you are. Additionally, for those seeking a more
structured approach, there's an extended 30-day program available
through the Momentum Community, offering detailed guidance and support
for discovering, acting upon, and adapting your core values. This
journey of self-discovery and value clarification is vital for
aligning your actions with your deepest beliefs and aspirations.

** Thought Experiments to Find Your Values

*** Desert Island Visualization

One effective thought experiment for discovering your core values is
the "Desert Island Visualization." Imagine yourself alone on a desert
island with all material needs provided. Here, free from societal
influences and pressures, consider what activities you would engage
in. This exercise helps highlight intrinsic values by removing
external pressures. If your imagined activities differ significantly
from your current lifestyle, it may indicate that you are living
according to others' values, not your own.

For example, someone might realize that they would still prioritize
reading and creative pursuits, revealing genuine personal
values. Conversely, a significant discrepancy between your desert
island activities and daily life suggests the need to realign with
authentic values.

*** Funeral Visualization

In contrast, the /"Funeral Visualization"/ exercise considers your
legacy. Imagine attending your own funeral and reflect on what you
hope people will say about you. This thought experiment focuses on the
social impact and legacy you wish to leave behind, encouraging
introspection about how you want to be remembered.

For instance, if you desire people to say you were generous and gave
more than you took, it points to benevolence as a core value. This
exercise can provide clarity on the values you aspire to embody and
the influence you wish to have on others.

*** Identifying Frustrations as Value Clues

Another technique involves analyzing recurring frustrations or pet
peeves in your life. These often indicate underlying values that are
unmet or challenged. For instance, if incompetence consistently
irritates you, it may reflect a strong value for competence and
mastery.

*** Ranking and Prioritizing Values

Finally, prioritize values by comparing them directly. When forced to
choose between two values (e.g., honesty versus competency), note your
gut reaction. This common thought experiment helps clarify which
values hold more significance to you. These decisions often occur at a
visceral level, highlighting the deep-seated nature of values.

*** Disposition vs. Aspiration

Discussing the nature of values brings up whether they are
dispositional (innate) or aspirational (ideal-based). While values
likely have genetic and social components, they can be adjusted over
time to some extent. Achievement and community might serve as an
example where values can shift more incrementally towards desired
aspirations.

Overall, these exercises encourage an exploration of intrinsic
motivations, leading to a deeper understanding of what truly matters,
while recognizing the potential for gradual adaptation and growth in
personal values.

** The Instrumental Value of Golf

This fable about Tiger Woods serves as a humorous and enlightening
tale about recognizing what we truly value in life versus the
instrumental value of certain activities.

*** The Story

The narrator recounts an opportunity to play golf with Tiger Woods and
Will Smith—a chance presented due to their mutual friendship. The
narrator, not being a golfer and disinterested in the sport, initially
declined the invitation due to the pressure of embarrassing themselves
on the course. Unbeknownst to them, they were missing out on an
exclusive opportunity for personal networking and bonding.

The realization dawned afterward: golf, beyond being a sport, serves
as a powerful social tool among successful individuals, facilitating
intimate conversations and relationship building. Inspired by the
missed chance, the narrator briefly considered learning golf to access
these networking opportunities.

*** Realization and Reflection

Despite attempts to get into golf, including lessons and outings with
friends and family, the narrator found no joy in the game itself. This
led to an important realization: the motivation to play golf was
driven by its perceived instrumental value, not an inherent interest
in the sport. The narrator valued the social and professional
opportunities golf presented, not the activity itself.

*** Interpretation

The fable highlights the difference between instrumental values and
intrinsic values. It underscores the importance of pursuing activities
that align with our genuine passions and values rather than engaging
in pursuits solely for their potential benefits. In life,
understanding this distinction is crucial for making choices that are
fulfilling and aligned with our true interests.

*** Broader Message

As this anecdote illustrates, examining our motivations and
understanding the difference between intrinsic enjoyment and
instrumental gain can guide us toward more authentic and satisfying
life decisions. It's a reminder to prioritize genuine values over
activities adopted purely for their perceived advantages.

** The Role of Trauma in Value Change

One of the pivotal ideas in understanding personal growth is
recognizing how trauma and adversity can lead to significant shifts in
our values. While we often focus on what we desire and aspire to gain,
true value change comes from what we are willing to sacrifice.

*** Choosing Your Struggle

The concept of /"choosing your struggle"/ emphasizes that values
aren't just about desire but about what we're ready to prioritize and
sacrifice for. The highest values in our hierarchy are those we are
willing to give up other things for. This helps explain why life
changes are often catalyzed by negative events or trauma, forcing us
to reevaluate and re-prioritize our deepest values.

*** Post-Traumatic Growth Theory

Post-Traumatic Growth Theory explores how individuals often report
positive changes following traumatic experiences. Research indicates
that 80-90% of people note at least one positive shift in their lives
after a trauma. This isn't to romanticize trauma; rather, it shows
human resilience and the ability to thrive despite adversity.

Trauma forces a reassessment of values, as it often exposes the
failure of previously held beliefs. In this re-evaluation process,
individuals may:
- Improve relationships with others,
- Discover new possibilities in life,
- Develop increased personal strength,
- Gain a greater appreciation for life,
- Experience spiritual or existential growth.

*** The Vacuum Left by Trauma

Traumatic events create a void where old values or beliefs fail. This
void presents an opportunity for growth, requiring new values to fill
the space. While this process is often painful and challenging, it
opens the door to meaningful change.

*** Example of Value Shift

A common scenario is someone facing a terminal illness, catalyzing a
shift from values like career success to more personal ones like
family and relationships. This stark contrast makes individuals
reassess what truly matters, prompting a reprioritization of values.

*** Holding Positives and Negatives Together

It's important to acknowledge that positive value changes can
accompany the enduring negative impacts of trauma. These changes
aren't exclusively favorable, nor do they negate the challenges of the
trauma itself. For example, cancer survivors might report increased
gratitude post-recovery, highlighting the coexistence of trauma's dual
nature: painful yet sometimes growth-inducing.

In summary, trauma challenges our existing values and beliefs, often
serving as a powerful catalyst for personal growth and value
transformation. Recognizing this dynamic helps individuals navigate
life’s complexities with a deeper awareness of what truly matters to
them.

* How to Change Your Values

In this chapter, we'll explore the process of /value change/,
acknowledging the undeniable influence of experiences, particularly
traumatic ones. While traumatic events can sometimes lead to shifts in
values, the extent and nature of this change depend on various
factors, including personality traits, coping strategies, and the
nature of the event itself.

For those with optimistic outlooks or openness to new experiences,
change is often more attainable. An effective coping style known as
/"active rumination"/ plays a significant role in post-traumatic
growth. This involves deliberately engaging with one's thoughts and
emotions following a traumatic event, facilitating cognitive
reappraisal and the exploration of how such experiences can challenge
or reshape existing values.

Another crucial factor in fostering positive value change is one's
social environment. A supportive network—whether family, friends, or
community—can significantly influence the likelihood of positive
growth following trauma. Being surrounded by individuals or a culture
that encourages open discussion, reflection, and reinterpretation of
trauma can be pivotal in navigating value changes effectively. This
support network offers the encouragement and perspective needed to
reshape values in a constructive and affirming manner.

** Kazimierz Dabrowski and Positive Disintegration

Kazimierz Dabrowski, a renowned yet lesser-known psychologist,
introduced the concept of "Positive Disintegration," offering a unique
perspective on personal growth through adversity. Working in
post-World War II Poland under Soviet occupation, Dabrowski focused on
tragedy and trauma, diverging from the Western psychological focus on
self-esteem and happiness.

*** Concept of Positive Disintegration

Dabrowski observed that many Holocaust survivors and Polish war
veterans reported significant personal growth after enduring immense
trauma. Though initially experiencing despair, some survivors
expressed that post-tragedy, they became better individuals—more
grateful, ambitious, and connected to others. Dabrowski termed this
process "positive disintegration," positing that trauma causes a
disintegration of the ego, shaking core beliefs and values.

This ego destruction leaves a vacuum that, if filled with more
adaptive and healthy values, fosters growth. The traumatic event
essentially forces a re-evaluation of one's value system, leading to
personal development.

*** Legacy and Impact

Dabrowski's work remained largely unknown for decades due to
geopolitical barriers until it was revitalized by researchers in the
early 2000s. His theory aligns with concepts like post-traumatic
growth, emphasizing how crisis can lead to re-evaluating and
strengthening values.

*** Personal Stories of Positive Change

The discussion also highlights personal experiences of value
transformation through trauma. For instance, a family loss prompted a
deeper appreciation for family values, while another recounted the
tragic loss of a friend, which spurred a significant life realignment
toward responsibility and achievement.

*** Cultural Influences on Value Re-evaluation

Research suggests that individualistic cultures, like the U.S., often
lead to re-evaluation towards self-focused achievements, while
collectivist cultures emphasize societal and moral duties. This
illustrates the interplay between personal experiences and larger
cultural contexts in shaping our value transformations.

Overall, Dabrowski's theory of Positive Disintegration underscores how
adversity can catalyze profound personal growth, encouraging a
redefinition of priorities and fostering resilience through conscious
re-evaluation.

** On Cults and Cognitive Dissonance

Cognitive dissonance, a concept introduced by psychologist Leon
Festinger, plays a crucial role in understanding how and why our
values change—or why they may stubbornly remain the same. Cognitive
dissonance occurs when there's a disconnect between our beliefs and
experiences, creating mental discomfort that we are motivated to
resolve.

*** The Story of Festinger’s Research

In an iconic study, Festinger infiltrated a cult led by Marian Keech,
who predicted an imminent alien invasion. The researchers observed
that when the prophecy failed, rather than abandoning their beliefs,
the cult members doubled down on their commitment. They interpreted
the lack of an invasion as a success of their efforts, amplifying
their dedication.

*** Cognitive Dissonance and Belief Change

When faced with contradictory evidence to their beliefs, individuals
experience dissonance, which they can resolve either by rejecting the
new reality or by modifying their beliefs. This mechanism explains why
cult members, faced with a failed prophecy, choose to strengthen their
commitment rather than abandon their faith. Leaving the cult means
losing the community and purpose it provides, which is often too
painful to consider.

*** The Role of Values in Cognitive Dissonance

Values are strategies to meet needs, and fundamental psychological
needs such as belonging and purpose are often intertwined with our
values. For those in a cult, these needs are fulfilled by their
beliefs, making it difficult to change without experiencing
significant personal loss.

*** Leveraging Cognitive Dissonance for Positive Change

To change your values intentionally, induce cognitive dissonance by
taking tangible actions that align with desired values—even if they
initially feel unnatural. By consistently acting on these values, the
accompanying dissonance will eventually realign your beliefs to match
your actions, reshaping your value hierarchy.

For example, deciding to prioritize family by spending more time with
them can initially feel discordant with other priorities. However, as
you invest more energy into these actions, your values can shift to
reflect this new focus.

*** Understanding Values in Argument and Discourse

Cognitive dissonance also impacts discourse, particularly in heated
arguments or political debates. Often, conflicts arise from misaligned
values rather than factual discrepancies. Successful dialogue requires
recognizing and addressing the correct underlying values rather than
challenging surface-level beliefs.

The complexity of value systems means that even factual debates are
deeply rooted in differing value prioritizations. Recognizing this
helps to engage in more empathetic and productive conversations,
focusing on common values rather than divisive facts.

** Self-Confrontation and Value Change

Milton Rokeach, renowned for developing the concepts of instrumental
and terminal values, further explored how individuals might change
their values through self-confrontation. His research focused on
prompting individuals to critically evaluate their own beliefs and
reasoning, ultimately facilitating value change.

*** The Self-Confrontation Method

During the civil rights era of the late 1960s, Rokeach conducted
studies involving individuals from different political
backgrounds—those on the left valuing equality and those on the right
emphasizing fairness, autonomy, and freedom. Participants engaged in
reflective exercises, choosing between values like freedom and
equality and writing essays defending their positions.

*** Reframing Values

Rokeach introduced a crucial step: reframing participants' cherished
values within the context of the opposing value. For instance, he
asked right-leaning individuals valuing freedom to consider civil
rights activists' actions as a fight for freedom, albeit under the
banner of equality. By encouraging participants to see their
opponents' values as an extension of their own, he facilitated a
surprising openness to new perspectives.

This exercise demonstrated that by packaging arguments in the values
of others, even deeply held beliefs could be shifted, highlighting the
power of value reframing in persuasion and self-reflection.

*** Implications for Persuasion

The success of Rokeach’s method underscores a critical aspect of
persuasion: framing arguments in terms of the recipient's values can
lead to more effective communication and transformative
understanding. This approach might also be applicable in broader
contexts, suggesting potential topics for exploring persuasion
strategies in future discussions.

In summary, Rokeach's self-confrontation method illustrates the
potential for thoughtful reflection and reframing to instigate
meaningful changes in one's value system. By challenging individuals
to examine their beliefs through the lens of alternative values, it
encourages personal growth and a broader understanding of complex
issues.

** Charlie Munger's Maxim: Incentives and Behavior

Charlie Munger, celebrated as the business partner of Warren Buffett
and known for his philosophical approach to investing, has an
insightful saying: "Show me the incentive and I'll show you the
behavior." This maxim underscores the powerful influence incentives
have on our actions and how they intertwine with cognitive dissonance
in shaping our values.

*** Linking Incentives and Cognitive Dissonance

We previously discussed how cognitive dissonance suggests that if you
act according to a desired value—despite initial discomfort—your
beliefs will eventually align with your actions. Munger's insight adds
another layer: creating incentives can strongly influence the
behaviors that align with those desired values.

*** Implementing Incentives

Consider the example of prioritizing family. If someone struggles to
put this value into practice, a direct method could involve scheduling
visits or calls. However, incorporating incentives could make this
shift more compelling. For instance, rewarding oneself with a trip of
choice for every visit made to family can motivate consistent action.

Equally applicable to fitness and nutrition, setting up rewards or
penalties can facilitate healthier choices. Whether it's through
gamification, collaborating with friends, or tracking progress, these
incentives nudge us toward health-oriented actions. As these behaviors
become routine, the cognitive dissonance resolves, reinforcing health
as a core value.

*** The Power of Sacrifice and Prioritization

Ultimately, values are shaped by what we are willing to
sacrifice. Munger's wisdom encapsulates the idea that identifying the
right incentives can guide our behavior toward aligning with our true
values. This framework not only reaffirms the connection between
actions and beliefs but also highlights the significance of deliberate
sacrifice in value prioritization.

By understanding and leveraging these strategies, individuals can
effectively cultivate value-driven actions and make meaningful changes
in their lives.




* Lessons and Takeaways

As we approach the conclusion of the episode, it's essential to
distill the key lessons and takeaways for applying the insights
discussed. Aristotle's concept of "practical wisdom" offers a useful
framework for understanding the application of values. He argued that
wisdom is the most critical virtue because it allows individuals to
balance and calibrate all other virtues. Wisdom helps determine when
to emphasize or deprioritize a particular value, acting as the guiding
force in managing our value hierarchy effectively.

To explore practical wisdom, we'll examine four key elements that
contribute to gaining clarity on our values and living them
authentically:

1. *Self-Awareness*: Understanding your values necessitates clarity
   around what you prioritize. Self-awareness involves recognizing
   these priorities and questioning whether they align with your true
   self. Methods like journaling, therapy, and meditation can enhance
   self-awareness, aiding in the identification and evaluation of
   values.

2. *Emotional Regulation*: Aligning emotions with values involves
   managing emotional responses to stay true to your priorities,
   especially in challenging situations. Techniques like Albert
   Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT) offer frameworks
   for understanding the interplay between events, beliefs, and
   emotional consequences, facilitating a values-aligned response.

3. *Social Relationships*: Relationships significantly impact value
   manifestation. Leveraging social circles that respect and amplify
   your values helps maintain alignment. Awareness of how values
   influence interpersonal dynamics is crucial, ensuring that
   relationships are supportive rather than obstructive.

4. *Self-Acceptance*: Carl Rogers highlighted the paradox that
   accepting oneself enables change. Embracing both strengths and
   vulnerabilities helps navigate the complexities of living according
   to one's values. Self-acceptance requires acknowledging
   imperfections and the inevitable discomfort accompanying
   value-centered living.

These principles constitute practical wisdom, empowering individuals
to understand and embody their values constructively. By fostering
self-awareness, regulating emotions, nurturing supportive
relationships, and practicing self-acceptance, individuals can achieve
a balanced and meaningful life grounded in their core values.

** The 80/20 of Values

To conclude the episode, let's distill the core insights using the
80/20 principle, which states that 20% of our efforts often yield 80%
of the results. Here's how this applies to understanding and working
with values:

*** 1. Clarity on Values

The most critical step is gaining clarity on what your values truly
are. Whether through thought experiments, reflection on past
decisions, or considering life’s challenges and frustrations,
understanding what you genuinely value provides a foundation for
self-awareness. This clarity alone sets you ahead of others who may
not consciously assess their values.

*** 2. Focus on Problems and Discomfort

Pay attention to the problems and discomforts in your life—they often
highlight the values at play. The challenges you face are reflections
of your value hierarchy. By understanding these issues, you can better
determine whether your current values serve your long-term goals.

*** 3. Self-Awareness and Emotional Regulation

Cultivate self-awareness to understand your reaction patterns, which
helps align your emotions with your values. Recognize the significance
of emotional regulation in maintaining value alignment, especially
during challenging situations.

*** 4. Relationship Dynamics

Examine friction points in relationships, as these can reveal value
mismatches. Building relationships that respect and enhance your
values requires understanding both your own and others'
perspectives. Encourage diversity rather than conformity of values
within your social circles.

*** 5. Differentiating Values

Once you identify what matters to you, rank your values to distinguish
higher priorities from lower ones. This helps make informed decisions
about where to invest your energy and attention, ensuring alignment
with your desired hierarchy of values.

*** 6. Practical Wisdom

Develop wisdom to adapt your values flexibly as life circumstances
change. Wisdom involves monitoring your value system, recognizing when
adjustments are needed, and making those changes gracefully.

*** 7. Cognitive Dissonance and Action

Recognize that values often follow action. To change your value
hierarchy, take action aligned with your desired values, even if it
feels uncomfortable at first. Overcoming initial resistance can lead
to a realignment of your values and reduce cognitive dissonance.

*** Sum Them Up

By focusing on these key areas, you can significantly enhance the
alignment of your actions with your core values, ultimately leading to
a more fulfilling and balanced life.

* What We Learned

Reflecting on the preparation and recording of this episode, several
key insights emerged.

1. *Self-Awareness and Value Shifts*: A significant takeaway was the
   realization of how much personal values can shift over time. As one
   ages, priorities change, and what seemed important in youth, like
   excitement and novelty, may yield to more enduring values. The
   importance of self-awareness in recognizing and adapting to these
   shifts cannot be overstated.

2. *The Interconnectedness of Values*: Understanding the network of
   values and how they interlace with each other highlighted the
   potential risk of over-focusing on a single value at the expense of
   others. Achieving a balance, much like maintaining a diversified
   stock portfolio, can prevent excessive dependency or harm from
   over-indexing on one area.

3. *Cultural and Social Reflections*: The reflection also extended
   to the broader cultural context, recognizing that tensions in
   values aren't necessarily conflicts between right or wrong but
   rather differences in prioritization. This perspective promotes
   empathy and understanding across various social and political
   divides.

4. *Communication in Relationships*: The discussion underscored the
   importance of recognizing when disagreements are rooted in
   differing values. It emphasized the need to approach such
   situations by ensuring discussions occur on the same level and
   acknowledging the diversity of values rather than assuming an
   intellectual or factual disagreement.

5. *Applying Wisdom in Daily Life*: The episode reiterated that
   practical wisdom involves continually monitoring and adjusting our
   values as life circumstances change. It’s about knowing when to
   elevate or demote values based on current priorities, ensuring our
   actions align with what matters most at the time.

* Next Steps

For those inspired to delve deeper into understanding and realigning
their values, the Momentum Community offers a structured 30-day
program to support this journey. Engaging with such a community can
provide the tools and accountability needed to make meaningful changes
and foster personal growth.

By embracing these lessons and actively participating in value
reflection, individuals can pave the way for a more fulfilling,
value-driven life. The insights gained from this episode serve as a
foundation for ongoing personal development and self-discovery.
