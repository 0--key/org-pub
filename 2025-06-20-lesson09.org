* The Fable

#+begin_quote
Paddy the Irishman bought a donkey from a farmer for £100. The farmer
agreed to deliver the donkey the next day.

The next day he drove up and said, 'Sorry Paddy, but I have some bad
news. *The donkey's died*.'

Paddy the Irishman bought a donkey from a farmer for £100. The farmer
agreed to deliver the donkey the next day.

The next day he drove up and said, 'Sorry Paddy, but I have some bad
news. The donkey's died.'

Paddy replied, 'Well then just give me my money back.'

The farmer said, 'Can't do that. I've already spent it.'

Paddy said, 'OK, then, just bring me the dead donkey.'

The farmer asked, 'What are you going to do with him?'

Paddy said, 'I'm going to raffle him off.'

The farmer said, 'You can't raffle a dead donkey!'

Paddy said, 'Sure I can. Watch me.. I just won't tell anybody he's
dead.'

-----

A month later, the farmer met up with Paddy and asked, 'What happened
with that dead donkey?'

Paddy said, 'I raffled him off. I sold 500 tickets at £2 each and made
a profit of £898'

The farmer said, 'Didn't anyone complain?'

Paddy said, 'Just the guy who won. So I gave him his £2 back.'


* Morphology in Linguistics

** Glossary

#+begin_quote
/Morphology/ is the study of the internal structure of words and the
rules for word formation, including the study of /morphemes/, which
are the smallest units of meaning or grammatical function.
#+end_quote
-----
#+begin_quote
A /morpheme/ is the smallest unit in a language that carries meaning
or grammatical function.

** The Role


Studying morphology is crucial because it:

1. Enhances Vocabulary: Understanding roots, prefixes, and suffixes helps
   learners decipher meanings of unfamiliar words.
2. Improves Grammar: Knowledge of morphological rules assists in using 
   correct verb tenses, plural forms, and other grammatical constructs.
3. Aids in Spelling: Recognizing morphemes can provide clues for spelling 
   difficult words.
4. Facilitates Language Acquisition: Helps in understanding word
   derivations and building a rich vocabulary.
5. Supports Reading Comprehension: Allows learners to break down complex
   words into understandable parts, improving comprehension.
6. Bridges Language Connections: Facilitates the learning of other 
   languages by recognizing universal morphological patterns.


** Types of Morphemes in English

1. =Free Morpheme=: A morpheme that can stand alone as a word without 
   needing additional morphemes (e.g., "book", "run").

2. =Bound Morpheme=: A morpheme that cannot stand alone and must be 
   attached to a free morpheme (e.g., "-s", "-ed", "un-").

3. =Root Morpheme=: The core part of a word that carries the primary 
   meaning (e.g., "tract" in "retract").

4. =Affix=: A bound morpheme added to a root. There are subcategories:
   - =Prefix=: An affix placed before the root (e.g., "un-" in 
     "unhappy").
   - =Suffix=: An affix placed after the root (e.g., "-ment" in 
     "agreement").
   - =Infix=: An affix inserted within a word, not commonly used in 
     English.

5. =Inflectional Morpheme=: A bound morpheme that modifies a word's tense,
   number, aspect, mood, or gender without changing its class or meaning
   (e.g., "-s" for plurals, "-ed" for past tense).

6. =Derivational Morpheme=: A bound morpheme that changes the meaning or
   part of speech of a word (e.g., "happy" to "happiness" with the 
   addition of "-ness").



* Suffixes, prefixes and endings

** Definitions
#+begin_quote
=Suffix=: A type of affix attached to the end of a root or base word
that alters its meaning or grammatical function (e.g., "-ness" in 
"kindness").

------

=Prefix=: A type of affix added to the beginning of a root or base word
that modifies its meaning (e.g., "un-" in "unhappy").

------

=Ending=: Though sometimes used interchangeably with "suffix," in 
morphological context, it often refers specifically to inflectional 
morphemes that indicate grammatical distinctions such as tense, 
mood, number, or case (e.g., "-ed" in "walked" for past tense).

** Common English Suffixes and Their Meanings

*** =-s / -es=
Indicates plural form of nouns or third person singular present tense
of verbs (e.g., "cats", "runs").

*** =-ed=

"walked").

*** =-ing=
Denotes the present participle or gerund form of verbs (e.g.,
"running").

*** =-ly=
Converts adjectives into adverbs, indicating manner (e.g., "quickly").

*** =-er / -or=
Used to form nouns indicating a person who performs an action (e.g.,
"teacher", "actor").

*** =-ion / -tion / -ation / -ition=
 Forms nouns indicating an action or process (e.g., "completion").

*** =-able / -ible=
 Denotes capability or worthiness (e.g., "readable", "audible").

*** =-al=
 Forms adjectives meaning "relating to" (e.g., "natural").

*** =-ment=
Creates nouns referring to an action or resulting state (e.g., 
"achievement").

*** =-ous=

** Common English Prefixes and Their Meanings

*** =un-=
Indicates negation or opposite (e.g., "unhappy" = not happy).

*** =re-=
Signifies repetition or backward motion (e.g., "rewrite" = write
again).

*** =in- / im- / il- / ir-=
Denotes negation or lack (e.g., "inactive" = not active, "impossible"
= not possible).

*** =dis-=
Implies negation or reversal (e.g., "disagree" = not agree).

*** =en- / em-=

*** =over-=
Signifies excess or superiority (e.g., "overcook" = cook too much).

*** =mis-=

*** =de-=
Implies removal, reversal, or reduction (e.g., "defrost" = remove
frost).

* Conclusion

Studying the morphology of English significantly enhances language
proficiency. It deepens understanding by revealing the structure and
formation of words, allowing learners to expand their vocabulary and
improve spelling intuitively. Grasping morphological rules aids in
mastering grammar, facilitating more accurate and versatile language
use. This knowledge also bolsters reading comprehension and assists in
interpreting new words through context and component analysis.

Moreover, it equips learners with skills transferable to
other languages, empowering them to recognize and apply linguistic
patterns universally. Ultimately, studying English morphology fosters
more effective communication and a richer, more nuanced mastery of the
language.
