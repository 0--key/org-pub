* Preamble

In this article, I intend to explain the *time-consuming* process of
learning a foreign language as a specific example of acquiring any
skill. Indeed, you can acquire any skill through /deliberate
practice/, and learning a foreign language is no exception.

#+begin_quote
  *Deliberate practice* is a focused and structured approach to
  learning and acquiring new skills, characterized by specific,
  goal-oriented activities that are designed to improve
  performance. Unlike regular practice, which might involve repetitive
  actions without a clear objective, deliberate practice involves
  concentrated effort /on areas that require improvement/.
#+end_quote

If you regularly engage in listening, speaking, reading, and writing
in a language, you will inevitably gain proficiency over time. The
speed and depth of your proficiency /depend greatly/ on how
extensively and consistently you immerse yourself in the language.

Acquiring a foreign language involves /consistent and deliberate
effort/. Much like mastering a musical instrument or becoming skilled
at a sport, learning a language requires dedication and practice. The
key is to immerse yourself in various language activities and to
persist with patience and perseverance. Each step you take, from
listening to native speakers to practicing writing, combines to build
your overall proficiency.

It's a journey that demands time and effort, but the rewards—such as
cultural understanding and enhanced communication skills — are well
worth it. My role is to whet your appetite for learning and transform
this lifelong journey into an ~exhilarating adventure~, rather than a
dull and tedious routine.

By igniting your curiosity and passion for language learning, I aim to
make this process engaging and enjoyable. With the right approach,
each step in your language acquisition can feel like an exciting
discovery, opening up new worlds and perspectives. I am here to guide
you, supporting you in overcoming challenges and celebrating your
progress, so that the path to mastering a foreign language becomes a
rewarding and enriching experience.


* The First Words

As you may observe, all humans are born without the ability to speak
and typically begin to produce their first words at around the age of
two years, or even later. It doesn't take a prophet to conclude that
*children learn* both how to speak and how to understand
language. While this fact is quite obvious, let's take a closer look
at *how* they achieve it.

Children are naturally immersed in a language-rich environment for at
least 12 hours every day. They generally sleep for about 10 hours,
spend approximately 2 hours in quieter activities like bathing and
eating, and devote the remaining time to actively engaging with
parents, relatives, siblings, peers, and others. When you consider
this, children are exposed to language for about 12 hours a day,
_adding up to over 4,000 hours each year_. Given this vast exposure,
it's no surprise that children acquire language skills rapidly.

#+begin_quote
So, naturally, by the age of six, a child typically knows about 2,500
to 5,000 words.
#+end_quote

This range can vary greatly depending on various factors such as the
child's exposure to language, the richness of their language
environment, and individual differences in learning pace. Children who
are more frequently engaged in conversations, read to regularly, and
encouraged to explore language tend to have larger vocabularies.
Continual exposure and practice are key to expanding a child's
vocabulary and language skills.

It is important to note that at this stage, a child typically *cannot
read or write*. Therefore, all of their linguistic knowledge is
acquired *only* through listening and asking questions.

By examining the process more closely, we can observe that the 
approximately 4,000 hours of immersion in a language-rich environment 
form the foundation for acquiring a vocabulary of around 2,500 to 5,000 
words.

These extensive hours of exposure to language are critical as they 
provide the necessary groundwork for children to build their linguistic 
abilities. During this time, children are constantly absorbing new 
words, phrases, and meanings through interactions, conversations, and 
listening to others. This natural and immersive language acquisition 
serves as the basis upon which they expand their vocabulary and 
communication skills.

The consistent daily interactions ensure that children are continuously 
engaged with the language, allowing for gradual yet steady vocabulary 
growth. This immersion not only helps them learn words but also aids in 
understanding context, improving comprehension, and fostering the 
ability to use language effectively in various situations.


* An Advanced Vocabulary

#+begin_quote
So, naturally, by the age of six, a child typically knows about 2,500
to 5,000 words.
#+end_quote

In that time, by the age of six, children begin attending classes in 
primary school. It is no secret that this is when teachers start 
to instruct them in the fundamentals of reading and writing.

This transition marks a significant milestone in a child's educational
journey. At this stage, children are introduced to the alphabet, basic
phonics, and simple words, setting the foundation for their literacy
skills.

#+begin_quote
The process is carefully structured to gradually build their
ability to recognize letters, sound out words, and *eventually read
and write independently*.
#+end_quote

The introduction of reading and writing not only enhances their
linguistic capabilities but also opens /the door to exploring new
ideas and knowledge/.


* Language-Centered Activities

** Primary School

Language-centered activities in primary school are designed to develop 
and enhance students' linguistic skills, focusing on reading, writing, 
listening, and speaking. These activities are crucial in helping young 
learners build a strong foundation in language use and comprehension.

  presentations, students practice speaking clearly and confidently in front 
  of their peers. These activities help them articulate their thoughts and 
  develop effective communication skills.

- =Phonics and Spelling Games=: Engaging games focused on sounds, spellings, 
  and word formation make learning fun and interactive. These activities 
  reinforce phonetic skills and spelling patterns, aiding in reading and 
  writing proficiency.

- =Role-Playing and Drama=: By participating in role-playing or drama activities, 
  students can practice dialogue and explore expressive language use. 
  Such activities enhance vocabulary, comprehension, and social skills.

- =Vocabulary Building Sessions=: Through interactive methods like word walls, 
  flashcards, and vocabulary quizzes, teachers help students expand their 
  word bank, fostering a richer and more varied use of language.

- =Vocabulary Size=: By the final years of primary school, typically
  around ages 10 to 12, students are expected to know approximately
  20,000 to 25,000 words.This vocabulary range can vary considerably
  based on factors such as the child's reading habits, educational
  environment, and exposure torich language experiences.

Throughout primary school, children's vocabularies expand
significantly as they engage in more complex reading, writing, and
conversation.  Exposure to diverse subjects and media also contributes
to vocabulary growth. Regular interactions with teachers and peers in
an educational setting provide students with opportunities to learn
and use new words in context, enhancing their understanding and
language proficiency.

** Secondary School

In secondary school, language-centered activities become more advanced, 
focusing on refining students' linguistic abilities through subject-specific 
immersion and more complex language use. The aim is to enhance their 
proficiency in reading, writing, listening, and speaking across various 
academic disciplines.

- =Advanced Reading Materials=: Students are introduced to a wider
  range of literature, including novels, essays, and articles relevant
  to different subjects. Critical reading and analysis are emphasized
  to develop deeper comprehension and interpretive skills.

- =Subject-Specific Vocabulary Building=: Each subject area offers
  opportunities to learn specialized vocabulary. Students engage in
  exercises and projects that require them to use subject-specific
  terminology accurately, fostering a deeper understanding of the
  material.

- =Essay and Report Writing=: Writing assignments become more structured and 
  analytical, requiring students to compose essays, reports, and research 
  papers. These tasks help students develop their ability to construct 
  logical arguments, organize ideas, and express their thoughts clearly.

- =Listening and Note-Taking Skills=: Emphasis is placed on effective listening 
  techniques and note-taking during lectures and presentations. These skills 
  are essential for understanding and retaining complex information across 
  various subjects.

- =Oral Presentations and Debates=: Students are encouraged to develop
  public speaking and argumentation skills through presentations and
  debates.  Such activities enhance their confidence, articulation,
  and ability to persuade or inform an audience.

- =Language and Literature Focus=: Courses in language arts and
  literature explore linguistic themes, literary analysis, and
  creative expression.  Students examine different styles, genres, and
  authors, enhancing their appreciation and understanding of language.

- =Interdisciplinary Projects=: Collaborative projects that require
  the integration of language skills with other subjects encourage
  students to apply their linguistic knowledge in diverse contexts,
  promoting comprehensive learning.

- =Vocabulary Size=: By the final years of secondary school, typically
  around ages 17 to 18, students are expected to know approximately
  40,000 to 50,000 words. This vocabulary growth is supported by
  continued exposure to diverse reading materials, subject-specific
  language, and complex language tasks throughout their secondary
  education.

In secondary school, language-centered activities focus on applying linguistic 
skills in a broader academic and social context. This approach prepares 
students for higher education and real-world communication, equipping them 
with the skills needed for both academic success and personal growth.

During this time, students engage in more sophisticated language use 
across various disciplines, including literature, social studies, and 
the sciences, which contributes to the expansion of their vocabulary. 

#+begin_quote
Additionally, the development of critical thinking, analytical skills, 
and more advanced communication practices further enhance their 
linguistic repertoire.
#+end_quote


* The Aim

It is reasonable to assume that all these activities during the school 
years are designed and implemented not as a form of punishment or toil 
for children, but rather to cultivate and enhance their ability to 
acquire knowledge independently, without relying on external stimuli.

The structured curriculum and varied learning experiences provided in
schools aim to equip students with the skills they /need to become
self-directed learners/. By engaging in these activities, students are
encouraged to explore their interests, think critically, and develop a
curiosity-driven approach to learning. This approach helps them gain
the confidence and competence needed to seek out information, solve
problems, and make informed decisions throughout their lives.

Ultimately, the goal is to empower students with the tools and mindset
necessary for lifelong learning, enabling them to adapt and thrive in
an ever-changing world.


* Conclusion
