*Cultural differences between human population in Western and Eastern
Europe due to artificial selection.*

#+begin_quote
Conventional wisdom postulates from the point of view of conditionally
/free/ man that, allegedly, all human strive for freedom, slaves are
human, so slaves endeavor to find the way to be free.
#+end_quote

*BUT*

#+begin_quote
The only dream of slaves /is not freedom or liberty/, â€” they usually
don't accustomed to live without strict and primitive orders from
their master, can't make right decisions about their life, and doomed
to death in misery on freedom.

Theirs impudent wish is /slaves possession/.

Theirs only dream is to become a *master*.
#+end_quote

The core idea is clear - all humans are equal. Yes, it is. They are
equal before when society separate and purpose them. After this
adaptation, usually accomplished in a young age, the metamorphosis is
so vivid and explicit, in some extraordinary cases it might be even
palpable. E.g. unarguably that society cast each member to fit into
its requirements.



* Premises

** Biology

All biological subjects are mutable and some positive mutations might
be observed in the next generations. This is evolution process.

Those spontaneous (or intentional) mutations which increase chances on
survival or even flourishing are positive, and cultivating through
several generations become characteristic for particular population.

** History

Obviously that Eastern and Western Europe's population has different
history.

** Religion

Widespread concept about Christianity is its initially target audience
were slaves, and its the only purpose was to foster submissiveness in
them.

Not a secret that the primary dogma in Orthodox Church teaching is a
complete deny of life on Earth. It dictates us the only life will be
on Heaven and only after than your body is dead. And your soul will
live there ethernally.

** Politics

Medieval witchhunt and mass repression in USSR have a lot in common,
but the scale is incomparable. Seems like Stalin deliberately,
intentionally and precisely eradicated 2-5% most liberal soviet
people, and uproot the idea of freedom in this population for several
centuries as minimum.


* Thesis

#+begin_quote
The pledge of /succeeding/ in closed, autocratic and slave society
aren't some eminent qualities or faculties such as literacy, physical
strength, experience etc., but /loyal, submissive and meek behavior/.
#+end_quote

* Antithesis

#+begin_quote
Discrepancy in behaviour is a miraculous feature, not a bug.
#+end_quote

* Hypothesis

#+begin_example
Due to the bundle of objective reasons
most of the Ukrainians are slaves by their nature.

And it might be noticeable observing their behavior,
the acute distinction among theirs words with theirs actions,
vain and futile attempts to mimic a free people's behavior.
