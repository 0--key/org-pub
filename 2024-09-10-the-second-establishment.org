Certainly! Here is a corrected and clarified version of your question:

"From the definition, a day is the time it takes for Earth to make a
full rotation on its axis. How did ancient scientists calculate the
duration of a day?"
#+end_src



#+begin_src markdown
Sure! Your corrected question reads clearly now. To provide an answer:

Ancient scientists used various observational methods to calculate the
duration of a day. One common method involved tracking the position of
the Sun in the sky. They observed the time it took for the Sun to
return to the same position in the sky on consecutive days, for
instance, from one noon to the next. This period is known as a solar
day. They measured this by using simple devices like sundials or by
marking shadows cast by objects to track the Sun's movement and
determine the length of daylight and night.

Additionally, ancient astronomers observed the stars and the phases of
the Moon to refine their understanding of time. The development and
use of astronomical calendars further helped ancient scientists and
civilizations keep accurate track of the day and time.

In summary, through careful and repeated observations of celestial
bodies, ancient scientists were able to estimate the duration of a day
with remarkable accuracy given the tools at their disposal.

** Solar Day
What is duration of solar day?



#+begin_src markdown
The duration of a solar day is approximately 24 hours, but it can vary
slightly throughout the year due to several factors, such as the
Earth's elliptical orbit and axial tilt.

To be precise:
- The mean solar day, which is an average over the year, is exactly 24
  hours or 86,400 seconds.
- However, the actual solar day can range from about 23 hours, 59
  minutes, and 39 seconds to about 24 hours and 30 seconds due to the
  equation of time.

This small variation is why we use "mean solar time" as a standard,
which averages out these differences over the course of a year.

** Year, day, hour, minute and second

If a solar day duration varies from one day to another how ancient
scientists determined an hour, minute and second?

#+begin_src markdown
Ancient scientists and timekeepers determined hours, minutes, and
seconds in ways that gradually became more precise over time. Though
the duration of a solar day can vary slightly throughout the year,
early timekeeping methods were primarily based on the average length
of the solar day.

Here's an overview of how they determined hours, minutes, and seconds:

### Hours:
1. **Ancient Egyptians**: They divided the day into 24 hours, with 12
   hours of daylight and 12 hours of nighttime. These hours were not
   of equal length but changed with the seasons.
2. **Babylonians**: They used a base-60 number system, and this
   influenced later divisions of time into 60 minutes and 60
   seconds. They divided the day into 24 equal parts.
3. **Greek and Roman Era**: With improvements, the Greeks and Romans
   adopted the 24-hour day with more uniform divisions.

### Minutes and Seconds:
1. **Medieval Islamic Scholars**: They made significant contributions
   to timekeeping, including more precise mechanical clocks that could
   measure smaller units of time.
2. **Medieval Europe**: By the 14th century, mechanical clocks in
   Europe began to feature minute hands. The division of an hour into
   60 minutes and each minute into 60 seconds became standard.
3. **Mechanical Clocks**: As mechanical clock technology improved,
   particularly with the advent of the pendulum clock by Christiaan
   Huygens in the 17th century, the measurement of time to the second
   became more accurate and practical.

### Practical Tools and Methods:
- **Sundials**: These were widely used to measure hours by casting a
  shadow on a marked surface.
- **Water Clocks (Clepsydras)**: Used to measure time intervals more
  uniformly than sundials, especially at night or on cloudy days.
- **Astronomical Observations**: Ancient astronomers could track the
  movement of stars and planets to determine time more accurately.

Despite the variations in the solar day, these tools allowed for a
practical, consistent measure of time. By relying on averages (mean
solar time) and through the incremental refinement of their
instruments, ancient and medieval scientists were able to establish
standardized units of hours, minutes, and seconds that are still in
use today.

* Modern second
Nowadays the duration of a day is precisely 24 hours, it is 86400
seconds. Who, when and how determined a day duration in such
incredible precision?

#+begin_src markdown
The precise determination of the duration of a day as 24 hours, which
is 86,400 seconds, has evolved over many centuries with significant
contributions from various scientists and technological advancements.

### Historical Development:

1. **Ancient Civilizations**: The basic division of the day into 24
   hours can be traced back to the ancient Egyptians and
   Babylonians. However, their definition lacked the precision we have
   today.

2. **Medieval Advances**: Islamic scholars and early European
   scientists made incremental improvements. For example, more
   accurate mechanical clocks began to develop in Europe around the
   14th century, leading to better measurements of hours and minutes.

3. **17th Century - Galileo and Huygens**: Galileo's studies on
   pendulums laid the groundwork for more accurate
   timekeeping. Christiaan Huygens, in 1656, invented the pendulum
   clock, significantly improving time measurement accuracy down to
   the second.

### Modern Precision:

1. **Development of the Second**:
   - **18th Century**: In 1960, the second was defined in terms of the
     Earth's rotation: 1/86,400th of a mean solar day.
   - **1967 Redefinition**: The second was redefined based on atomic
     standards, specifically the vibrations of cesium atoms. It was
     defined as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation corresponding to
     the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state
     of the cesium-133 atom.

2. **International System of Units (SI) and Coordinated Universal Time
   (UTC)**:
   - The **International System of Units (SI)** adopted this atomic
     definition of the second, ensuring a highly precise and stable
     unit of time.
   - **UTC** was established and is maintained using International
     Atomic Time (TAI), calculated using a worldwide network of atomic
     clocks.

3. **Global Positioning System (GPS)**:
   - Further refinements in time measurement and synchronization have
     come from GPS technology, which relies on extremely accurate
     atomic clocks.

### Key Institutions and Figures:
- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** in the USA
  and **International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)** play
  crucial roles in maintaining and disseminating precise time
  standards.
- **Louis Essen and Jack Parry**: Developed the first practical cesium
  atomic clock in 1955 at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK,
  crucial for establishing the modern second.

### Conclusion:
The duration of a day as exactly 86,400 seconds arises from the
definition of the second based on atomic timekeeping, a standard
maintained and synchronized globally through a network of atomic
clocks. Efforts by scientists over centuries, culminating in the
adoption of the cesium atom's properties, have provided the incredible
precision we rely on today.
