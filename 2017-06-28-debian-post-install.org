* Goal definition

  When you're dive into depth of software development with =Debian= as
  a main operational system sometimes it might emerge the urge to
  install it on a new host. As the current environment is homely and
  handy to use the aim is ~just~ to replicate it.

* Software installation

* FileTree extension

  On my point of view the most convenient place to put some shared
  data on your ~Debian 9~ host is =/usr/local/share/=

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ls -la /usr/local/share/
  #+END_SRC
