* Preamble

#+begin_quote
Starlette is a lightweight ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway
Interface) framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building async web
services in Python.
#+end_quote


Starlette is an impressive /and minimalist/ ASGI framework designed
for building efficient and high-performance web services in
Python.


* Main Features

** ASGI Compatibility:
*Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI)*: Starlette is built on
the ASGI specification which provides an interface between
asynchronous Python web servers and web applications or
frameworks. It’s designed to be fully asynchronous and capable of
handling a wide range of networking interfaces like HTTP, WebSockets,
and more.

** Routing:
    - *URL Routing*: Starlette provides a dynamic and flexible
     routing system for matching URL paths to Python functions. This
     feature supports path parameters, converters, and custom routes.

** Request and Response Middleware:
    - *Middleware*: Starlette supports middleware for request and
     response interception. This allows for tasks like authentication,
     logging, and error handling before the actual endpoint handler is
     invoked.

** Session Management:
    - *Sessions and Cookies*: It includes session and cookie
     management systems, allowing secure and stateful interactions
     with clients.

** WebSockets:
    - *WebSocket Support*: Starlette has native support for handling
     WebSocket connections, enabling real-time communication between
     the client and server.

** Static Files:
    - *Static Files Handling*: Starlette can serve static files
     including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets, making it easy
     to serve front-end applications or static content.

** Background Tasks:
    - *Background Task Management*: Easily manage background tasks
     allowing for deferred, out-of-band processing of time-consuming
     operations.

** GraphQL:
    - *GraphQL Integration*: It provides integration with GraphQL,
     supporting advanced API development paradigms.

** Testing:
    - *TestClient*: Starlette includes tools for testing
      applications, including a `TestClient` for writing unit tests
      and integration tests.

** CORS:
     - *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)*: Built-in middleware
       supports configuring CORS policies for secure cross-origin
       requests.


* Underlying Concepts of Starlette:

** ASGI:
   - The ASGI standard allows for an advanced concurrency model and
     greater scalability than WSGI (Web Server Gateway
     Interface). Starlette fully leverages ASGI by supporting async
     programming, making it ideal for I/O-bound and high-concurrency
     applications.

** Event Loop:
   - At the core of Starlette's asynchronous capabilities is the event
     loop provided by Python's `asyncio` library. It allows Starlette
     to handle many simultaneous connections efficiently by managing
     asynchronous tasks.

** Dependency Injection:
   - Starlette’s design promotes clean architecture and separation of
     concerns by supporting dependency injection patterns. This aids
     in creating modular and testable code.

** ACID Transactions:
   - Starlette can be used with databases via /async ORMs that support
     ACID transactions/, providing transactional integrity and
     durability.

** FastAPI Integration:
   - Starlette is also foundational for FastAPI, another popular web
     framework for building modern APIs with Python 3.6+ based on
     standard Python-type hints. By understanding Starlette, one
     inherently grasps significant parts of FastAPI as well.


* Example Code:

Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of Starlette:

#+begin_src python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.routing import Route
import uvicorn


async def homepage(request):
    return JSONResponse({'hello': 'world'})

routes = [Route('/', homepage), ]

app = Starlette(debug=True, routes=routes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host='127.0.0.1', port=8000)
#+end_src

* Conclusion

Starlette's minimalistic yet powerful design makes it a robust choice
for creating async-based web services in Python, whether as a
standalone framework or as part of FastAPI for more feature-rich
applications.
