  Is to unvail all subtleties about how-to utilize the power of all
  CPU's cores and avert its overloading simultaneously.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A context switch may happen on a core every fixed amount of time (a
  time slice) because the CPU automatically runs some kernel code
  periodically to permit preemption. Depending on the scheduler's
  rules, a task can be run for many time slices. A context switch can
  also occur when a thread calls functions that makes it unrunnable
  (eg. waiting for IO).
