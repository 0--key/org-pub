* Intro

  From the /official documentation/:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system
  (ORDBMS) based on POSTGRES, Version 4.2, developed at the University
  of California at Berkeley Computer Science Department. POSTGRES
  pioneered many concepts that only became available in some
  commercial database systems much later.
  #+END_QUOTE
* Installation

  =Debian= has a straightforward policy in OS administration: all
  secure or /unsecure/ operations are prohibited for ordinary user and
  allowed for ~root~ only. Thus all ~Postgres~ post-installation (it's
  a pun, but it is :) procedures should be accomplished as ~root~.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # apt-get install postgresql-doc postgresql postgresql-client
  # apt-get install pgadmin3 pgadmin3-data
