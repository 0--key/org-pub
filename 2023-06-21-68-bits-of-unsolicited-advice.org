* Greeting
Hi I'm Kevin Kelly and recently I turned 68 so I thought I would pull
up this rocking chair and sit in it and dispense some unsolicited
advice to young people.

/And that's what I'm about to do here are 68 bits of advice./


* Learn how to learn
from those who disagree with you or even offend you see if you can
find truth in what they believe.
* Being enthusiastic
is worth 25 IQ points
* Always demand a deadline
and deadlines sweeps out extraneous in the ordinary and that prevents
you from trying to make it perfect so you have to make it different
different is much better
* Don't be afraid to ask a question
that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is
thinking of that same question and is too embarrassed to ask it
* Being able to listen well
is a superpower while listening to someone you love keep asking them
is there more until there is no more a worthy goal for years to learn
enough about a subject so that you can't believe how ignorant you were
a year earlier
* Gratitude will unlock all
other virtues and is something you can get better at treating a person
to a meal
* Never fails and is so easy to do
it's powerful with old friends and it's a great way to make new
friends
* Don't trust all-purpose glue
* Reading to your children regularly
will bond you together and will kick-start their imaginations
* Never use a credit card for credit
the only kind of credit or debt that's acceptable is debt to acquire
something whose value and will increase over time like a house
* The exchange value of most things
diminishes or vanishes the moment you purchase the so don't be in debt
to losers
* Pros are just amateurs
who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes
* Extraordinary claims should require
extraordinary evidence to be believed
* Don't be the smartest person in the room
hang out with and learn from people smarter than yourself even better
find smart people who will disagree with you
* Rule of three in conversation
to get to the real reason ask a person to go deeper than what they
have just said then again and then once more the third times answer is
close to the truth
* Don't be the best be the only
everyone is shy other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself
to them they want you to send them an email they are waiting for you
to ask them on a date so go ahead
* Don't take it personally
when someone turns you down assume they are
just like you occupied distracted
* Try again later
it's amazing how often a
second try works the purpose of the
habit is to remove that action from self
negotiation you no longer expend energy
deciding whether to do it you just do it
good habits can range from telling the
truth to flossing promptness is a sign
of respect when you're young spend at
least six months to one year living as
poor as you can
owning as little as you possibly can
eating beans and rice in a tiny room or
tent to experience what your worst life
style may be that way
when you have something in the future
that you want at risk you won't be
afraid of the worst-case scenario
trust me there is no them the more there
you are interested in other
the more interesting they find you so to
be interesting be interested optimize
your generosity no one on their deathbed
has ever regretted giving away too much
to make something good just do it to
make something great just redo it redo
it redo it the secret to making fine
things is in remaking them the golden
rule will never fail you it is the
foundation of all the other virtues if
you're looking for something in your
house and then you finally find it when
you're done with it don't put it back
where you found it put it back where you
first looked for it saving money and
investing money are good habits small
amounts of money invested very regularly
for many decades without deliberation is
one path to wealth to make mistakes as
human to own your mistakes is divine
nothing elevates a person higher than
quickly admitting and taking personal
responsibilities for the mistakes that
you make and then fixing them fairly if
you mess up fess up it's astounding how
powerful this ownership is never get
involved in land war in Asia you can
obsess about serving your customers
clients audiences or you can obsess
about beating the competition both work
but of the two obsessing about your
customers will take you much further
show up keep showing up somebody's
successful once said 99% of success is
just showing up separate the process of
creation from improving you can't write
and edit or sculpt and polish or make
and analyze at the same time if you do
the editor stops the creator while you
invent don't select while you sketch
don't inspect while you're right there
straf don't reflect at the start the
creator mining must be Unleashed from
judgment if you're not falling down
occasionally you're just coasting
perhaps the most counterintuitive truth
of the universe is that the more you
give to others the more you'll get
understanding that is the beginning of
wisdom friends are better than money
almost anything that money can do
friends can do better in so many ways a
friend with a boat is better than owning
about this is true it is hard to cheat
an honest man when an object has lost
none 9 percent of the time it is hiding
within arm's reach of where it was last
seen so search in all possible locations
in that radius and you'll find it you
are what you do not what you say not
what you believe and not how you vote
but what you spend your time on if you
lose or forget to bring a cable and
adapter or charger check with your hotel
most hotels have a drawer full of cables
and doctors and chargers that others
have left behind and probably have the
one that you want if you can claim it
after you borrow it hitch it is a curse
that does not affect the hated it only
affects the hater
so release a grudge as this as if it was
poison there is no limit on better town
is unevenly distributed but there is no
limit on how much we can do with what we
start with be prepared when you are 90%
done any large project like a house a
film an event a nap the rest of the
myriad details will take on second 90%
to complete when you die you take
absolutely nothing with you except your
reputation before you are old at
as many funerals as you can bear and
listen nobody talks about the departed's
achievements the only thing people
mentioned is what kind of person you
were
while you were achieving for every
dollar you spend purchasing something
substantial expect to pay $1 in repairs
maintenance or disposal by the end of
its life anything real begins with a
fiction of what it could be
imagination therefore is the most potent
force in the universe
in a skill you can get better at it's
the one skill in life that benefits from
ignoring what everybody else knows when
crisis and disaster strike don't waste
them no problems no progress on vacation
go to the most remote place on your
itinerary first bypassing the cities
you'll maximize the shock of other nough
sin the remote and then later you'll
welcome the familiar comforts of a city
on the way back when you get an
invitation to do something in the future
ask yourself would I accept this if it
was scheduled for tomorrow mmm not too
many promises will pass that immediacy
filter don't say anything about someone
in an email that you would not be
comfortable saying to them directly
because eventually they will read it if
you desperately need a job you are just
another problem for a boss but if you
can solve many of the problems the boss
has right now you are hired to be hired
think like your boss art is in what you
leave out acquiring things will rarely
bring you deep satisfaction but
acquiring experiences will rule of 7 and
research you can find out almost
anything if you're willing to go seven
levels if the first source you ask
doesn't know then you ask them who you
should ask next and so on down the line
if you're willing to do that to the
seventh source you will almost always
get your answer how to apologize quickly
specifically sincerely don't ever
respond to a solicitation or proposal on
the phone the urgency is a disguise when
someone is nasty or rude or hateful or
mean with you pretend that they have a
disease that makes it easier to have
empathy towards them which can often
soften the conflict eliminating clutter
makes room for your true treasures you
don't really want to be famous read the
biography of any famous person
experience is overrated when hiring hire
four aptitude trained for skills most
really amazing or great things have been
done by people doing them for the very
first time a vacation plus a disaster
equals an adventure buying tools start
with buying the absolute cheapest tools
you can find upgrade the ones that you
use a lot if you wind up using something
as a tool for a job by the very best you
can afford learn how to take a 20 minute
power nap without embarrassment
following your bliss is a recipe for
paralysis if you don't know what you are
passionate about a better motto for most
youth is to master something anything
through mastery of one thing you can
drift towards extensions of that mastery
that bring you more joy and eventually
you'll discover where your bliss is I'm
positive that in 100 years much of what
I take to be true today will be proved
to be wrong maybe even in bearer
wrong and I try really hard to identify
what it is that I am wrong about today
over the long term the future is decided
by optimist to be an optimist you don't
have to ignore the many problems we
create you have to imagine improving our
capacity to solve those problems the
universe is conspiring behind your back
to make you a success this would be much
easier to do if you embrace this pronoia
thank you for listening and I hope I was
helpful
