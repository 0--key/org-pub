* Intro

As humankind, we stand on the brink of a new era in our intellectual
evolution: /AI-augmented education/ is the cornerstone of this
transformation. While the incredible speed and access to information,
provided by technologies like OpenAI, present unprecedented
opportunities, human nature remains unchanged. We are still inherently
/biased *biological* organisms/.

* Acid Note

#+begin_quote
All the information you can comprehend must pass sequentially through
the narrow filter of your experience, shrouded by cognitive biases and
the twilight of consciousness. It is no surprise that you mostly
operate with overly limited and significantly distorted data.

*Anton Philomath*

* The Mission

The mission of =Learnosity= is to provide technology that reliably
retrieves relevant, precise, and comprehensive information based on
users' queries. The /learning techniques/ should significantly enhance
users' comprehension and, consequently, the /effectiveness of
learning/. Ideally, these techniques should also make the learning
process satisfying and enjoyable.

* Precaution

The ability to teach effectively is highly correlated with the
teacher's own skills. First and foremost, /the teacher must be
proficient in the subject they are instructing/. Additionally,
patience and persistence are essential qualities. =Conversely=,
attempting to teach a skill with only a vague or uncertain
understanding often results in a futile waste of time.

A team that does not culturally embrace, or even actively negates, the
core (*biological*) principles of education cannot positively impact
their customers' learning experience merely by providing access to
information. The /paramount goal/ should be to first teach effective
methods and approaches to studying. Once customers are /well-prepared
methodically/, providing them with information will be far more
beneficial.

* My Role at Learnosity

My extensive experience in self-learning and teaching an adult learner
/(my dear wife btw)/, has led me to conclude the effectiveness of
unconventional, challenging, counterintuitive, and sometimes even
painful, but /scientifically proved approaches to effective
studying/. My goal is to share this unique experience with the team,
suggest the most effective learning strategies personally, and assist
them on their difficult and long journey to acquire knowledge.

OpenAI, Emacs, and Python are only the powerful tools that I utilize
to leverage my own capabilities.

* Concluson

I am eager to bring my expertise and passion for education to
Learnosity, helping to create transformative learning experiences and
methodologies for your customers.

We all, as a humankind are on the brink of new era in our intellectual
evolution: augumented by AI educatoin is the cornerstone here. If it
is clear about the incredible speed in access for all sorts of
information (OpenAI provides this bizzare opportunity), in the same
moment the nature of human still be the same: they are the strictly
biased biological organisms.
