* Preface
** Official

#+begin_verse
lambda

     An anonymous inline function consisting of a single
     expression which is evaluated when the function is called.
     The syntax to create a lambda function is ‘lambda [parameters]:
     expression’
#+end_verse

#+begin_verse
expression

     A piece of syntax which can be evaluated to some value.  In other
     words, an expression is an accumulation of expression elements like
     literals, names, attribute access, operators or function calls
     which all return a value.  In contrast to many other languages, not
     all language constructs are expressions.  There are also 
     statement, which cannot be used as expressions, such as
     while. Assignments are also statements, not expressions.

** Alternative definition

#+begin_quote
Python lambdas are little, anonymous functions, subject to a more
restrictive but more concise syntax than regular Python functions.

Hello! Call me Tony, please, and I will call you Rod. Good afternoon!

#+begin_src markdown
Good afternoon, Tony! It's nice to meet you. How can I assist you with
your computer science or Python programming questions today?
#+end_src

Today we'll dissect =Python= ~lambda~ function. Which questions you
might suggest to disclose this topic explicitly? I'm working now in
Emacs with Org-mode Babel code snippets, so could you answer on my
questions using =Org= markup, please?


#+begin_src markdown
Absolutely, Tony! The Python `lambda` function is a powerful tool,
albeit sometimes a bit confusing at first glance. To thoroughly
dissect and understand lambda functions, we could consider the
following questions:

1. **Introduction to Lambda Functions:**
   - What is a lambda function in Python?
   - How does a lambda function differ from a regular function defined
     using `def`?

2. **Syntax and Usage:**
   - What is the syntax for creating a lambda function?
   - How can you assign a lambda function to a variable?
   - Can a lambda function have multiple parameters?

3. **Common Use Cases:**
   - When and why would you use a lambda function over a regular
     function?
   - How are lambda functions commonly used with higher-order
     functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`?

4. **Limitations:**
   - What are the limitations of lambda functions compared to regular
     functions?
   - Can you include statements (e.g., loops, `if` statements) within
     a lambda function?

5. **Advanced Applications:**
   - How can lambda functions be used in conjunction with list
     comprehensions?
   - What role do lambda functions play in functional programming
     paradigms in Python?
   - Can you demonstrate a complex example where a lambda function is
     useful?

6. **Best Practices:**
   - What are some best practices for using lambda functions in
     Python?
   - What are the readability concerns when using lambda functions?

Should I start with a basic explanation and examples of what a lambda
function is and how it differs from a regular function?
