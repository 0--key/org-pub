* Proverbs And Sayings

** Definitions

Here are the definitions of proverbs and sayings:

- =Proverb=: A proverb is a short, commonly known expression that
  imparts traditional wisdom, truth, or moral advice. Proverbs are
  often metaphorical and have been passed down through generations,
  encapsulating cultural values and shared experiences. An example
  would be "Actions speak louder than words."

- =Saying=: A saying is a general term that refers to any well-known
  phrase or expression that conveys a truth or observation about
  life. Sayings often include proverbs but can also encompass other
  forms of popular expressions, such as idioms or adages. They are
  typically less formal than proverbs. An example of a saying is "The
  early bird catches the worm."

While both proverbs and sayings encapsulate shared knowledge, proverbs
typically convey specific moral lessons, whereas sayings may include a
broader range of expressions about life and human nature.

** Samples

Here are ten proverbs and sayings that emphasize the values
of diligence and patience:

1. "Patience is a virtue."
2. "Good things come to those who wait."
3. "The early bird catches the worm."
4. "Slow and steady wins the race."
5. "Rome wasn't built in a day."
6. "All things are difficult before they are easy."
7. "Perseverance conquers all things."
8. "A watched pot never boils."
9. "Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet."
10. "He who hesitates is lost."

These proverbs and sayings highlight the importance of steady effort
and the value of waiting for rewarding results.

3. "A fool and his money are soon parted."
4. "Look before you leap."
5. "There's no fool like an old fool."

* YouTube Shadowing

I would like to propose an exercise for enhancing pronunciation
fluency called /"YouTube Shadowing"/. To begin, find a video clip that
interests you and launch it. Make sure to turn on the captions to
follow along. After listening to each sentence, pause the video and
replicate the sentence, mimicking the presenter's pronunciation as
closely as possible. Continue this process, repeating as needed, to
refine your pronunciation skills and improve your fluency.

I would suggest to use materials from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDGCWou3ph4][this channel]].
