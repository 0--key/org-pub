** Core ideas:

   - Black (Pandorra) Box approach;
   - Programming languages genealygy:
     + Atavisms:
       + 72 char per string;
   - Codex as a phenomena disclosure;
   - Related material allocation on two pages at once;
   - Conversion into a fiction book;
   - Pomodoro technique realization;

** Primary material gathering;

*** Books

*** Quotes

    - "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally  
     for machines to execute."

     Abelson & Sussman, SICP, preface to the first edition

    - "Short words are best and the old words when short are best of all."

      Winston Churchill

    - “The glass is neither half empty nor half full. It’s simply
      larger than it needs to be.”

      Grace Hopper

    - “Manage things. Lead people.”

      Grace Hopper

*** Snippets

*** Thoughts

    Why computer programming is a such tough task for humans? There
    are several plain predicatives to deem that is just overthinked.

**** 5 basic concepts of any programming language:

     - Variables;
     - Data structures;
     - Control structures;
     - Syntax;
     - Tools;


     
**** Major paradigms of programming:

     - Imperative;
     - Logical;
     - Functional;
     - Object-oriented;
**** General observations:
     
     - Cognitive dissonance and size of manuals;
     - An average age of readers;
     - Avoidance of source code reading (escapism); 
     - Testing as an innate tool to learn for humans;
     - Testing in CS is a comparatively young concept;
     - Einstellung effect in writing book about programming;
     - Debugging is a major task for a typical programmer and often it
       consumes up to 90% of their efforts to develop and maintain
       software nowadays;



    
** Indexing as an ordered sequence;

** Wrapping and extension.
