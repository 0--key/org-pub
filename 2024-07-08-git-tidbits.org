* Intro

* How to make my own private repository on some particular folder?


#+begin_src markdown
  To create a private Git repository in a specific folder, follow these
  steps:

  1. **Navigate to the folder**:
     ```sh
     cd /path/to/your/folder
     ```

  2. **Initialize the Git repository**:
     ```sh
     git init
     ```

  3. **Add your files to the repository**:
     ```sh
     git add .
     ```

  4. **Commit the files**:
     ```sh
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

  5. **Host your private repository**:
     - If you want to host it locally, you're done. To share it,
       consider setting up a SSH server.
     - If you want to host it remotely (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):
       - Create a new private repository on the hosting site.
       - Add the remote repository URL:
         ```sh
         git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>
         ```
       - Push your local repository to the remote one:
         ```sh
         git push -u origin master
         ```

  Note that on popular hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, and
  Bitbucket, you can create private repositories directly through their
  web interfaces.

* Is a private repository on GitHub free?


#+begin_src markdown
  Yes, GitHub offers free private repositories with certain
  limitations. Here are some key points:

  1. **Free Plan**:
      - Unlimited private repositories.
      - Unlimited collaborators.
      - Limited to 2,000 Actions minutes per month (for CI/CD).
      - Some knowledge of usage and resource limits.

  2. **Paid Plans**:
      - **GitHub Pro and Team**: Offer additional features such as more
        Actions minutes, advanced security features, and more.
      - **GitHub Enterprise**: Suitable for large organizations with
        enhanced administrative and security features.

  For most individual and small team use cases, the free plan is
  sufficient for using private repositories. You can find detailed and
  up-to-date information on GitHub's pricing page.

* How can I add other users as contributors of my private repository on GitHub?


#+begin_src markdown
  To add contributors to your private repository on GitHub, follow these
  steps:

  1. **Go to Your Repository**:
     - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.

  2. **Open the Settings**:
     - Click on the "Settings" tab, which is usually located on the
       right side of the repository menu.

  3. **Access Manage Access**:
     - In the left sidebar, click on "Manage access."

  4. **Invite a Collaborator**:
     - Click on the green "Invite a collaborator" button.

  5. **Enter the GitHub Username**:
     - Enter the GitHub username or email of the person you want to add
       as a collaborator.

  6. **Send the Invitation**:
     - Click the "Add <username>" button to send an invitation.

  7. **Collaborator Accepts the Invitation**:
     - The invited collaborator will receive an email notification. They
       need to accept the invitation to gain access to the repository.

  8. **Set Permissions (optional)**:
     - After the user accepts the invitation, you can adjust their role
       by clicking the dropdown next to their name in the "Manage
       access" page. You can set them as Read, Write, or admin based on
       the access level they need.

  By following these steps, you will be able to add other users as
  collaborators to your private repository.

* Pull conflict

I made several commits, but when I try to push it the conflict happen:
there are some changes in my repository, and my local version of it is
obsolete. I review the newest commits and seems like they don't
intersect with mine ones. What you can suggest in this case?

#+begin_src markdown
  When you encounter a conflict due to your local branch being behind
  the remote branch, you can resolve this by pulling the latest changes
  from the remote repository and then merging any conflicts. Here are
  the steps:

  1. **Fetch the latest changes**:
     ```sh
     git fetch origin
     ```

  2. **Merge the changes**:
     If your local work is on the `master` branch (replace with your actual branch if different), you need to merge the changes from the remote branch:
     ```sh
     git merge origin/master
     ```

     If there are no conflicts, this will merge smoothly. If there are
     conflicts, Git will mark them in the files, and you need to resolve
     them manually.

  3. **Resolve conflicts** (if any): Open the conflicting files, look
     for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), and resolve
     the differences.

     In Emacs using Magit:
     - Open the conflicting file.
     - Use `M-x magit-status` to open the Magit status buffer.
     - Magit will list the conflicts. Use `e` (edit) on the conflicted
       files to open them.
     - Resolve the conflicts manually.
     - After resolving, stage the resolved files (`s` in the Magit
       status buffer).

  4. **Add and commit the resolved conflicts**:
     ```sh
     git add <resolved_files>
     git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
     ```

  5. **Push your changes**:
     ```sh
     git push origin master
     ```

  ,**Alternative approach using rebase**: If you prefer a cleaner
  history, you can use rebase instead of merge:

  1. **Fetch and rebase**:
     ```sh
     git fetch origin
     git rebase origin/master
     ```

     Resolve any conflicts during the rebase process, just as you would
     with a merge.

  2. **Continue rebase after resolving conflicts**:
     ```sh
     git rebase --continue
     ```

  3. **Push your rebased branch**:
     In case of rebase, you might need to force push because rebase rewrites history.
     ```sh
     git push --force origin master
     ```

  Choose the method (merge or rebase) based on your preference for
  handling the commit history.
