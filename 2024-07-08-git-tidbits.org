* Intro

* How to make my own private repository on some particular folder?


#+begin_src markdown
  To create a private Git repository in a specific folder, follow these
  steps:

  1. **Navigate to the folder**:
     ```sh
     cd /path/to/your/folder
     ```

  2. **Initialize the Git repository**:
     ```sh
     git init
     ```

  3. **Add your files to the repository**:
     ```sh
     git add .
     ```

  4. **Commit the files**:
     ```sh
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

  5. **Host your private repository**:
     - If you want to host it locally, you're done. To share it,
       consider setting up a SSH server.
     - If you want to host it remotely (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):
       - Create a new private repository on the hosting site.
       - Add the remote repository URL:
         ```sh
         git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>
         ```
       - Push your local repository to the remote one:
         ```sh
         git push -u origin master
         ```

  Note that on popular hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, and
  Bitbucket, you can create private repositories directly through their
  web interfaces.

* Is a private repository on GitHub free?


#+begin_src markdown
  Yes, GitHub offers free private repositories with certain
  limitations. Here are some key points:

  1. **Free Plan**:
      - Unlimited private repositories.
      - Unlimited collaborators.
      - Limited to 2,000 Actions minutes per month (for CI/CD).
      - Some knowledge of usage and resource limits.

  2. **Paid Plans**:
      - **GitHub Pro and Team**: Offer additional features such as more
        Actions minutes, advanced security features, and more.
      - **GitHub Enterprise**: Suitable for large organizations with
        enhanced administrative and security features.

  For most individual and small team use cases, the free plan is
  sufficient for using private repositories. You can find detailed and
  up-to-date information on GitHub's pricing page.
