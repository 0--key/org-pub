 Here are some of the essential reasons for creating synergy among
 your team is so important:

- Increased productivity: When team members work together effectively,
  they can share knowledge and expertise, leading to faster and more
  efficient problem-solving. They can also divide and conquer tasks,
  freeing time for each team member to focus on their strengths.
- Enhanced innovation: When team members feel comfortable sharing
  their ideas, they are more likely to develop innovative solutions to
  problems. They can also learn from each other's perspectives, which
  can help them to see problems in new ways.

- Improved problem-solving: When team members work together, they can
  pool their knowledge and resources to develop creative solutions to
  problems. They can also provide each other with support and
  encouragement, which can help them to persevere in the face of
  challenges.

- Increased employee satisfaction: When team members feel
  like they are part of a cohesive team and their contributions are
  valued, they are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs. This
  can lead to lower turnover and increased engagement.

Here are some tips for implementing synergy in your team:

- Create a positive team culture: A positive team culture is one where
  team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas, taking risks, and
  learning from each other. This can be created by fostering open
  communication, celebrating successes, and providing regular
  feedback.
- Set clear goals and expectations: When team members know
  what is expected of them and what they are working towards, they are
  more likely to be aligned and motivated. Set challenging but
  achievable goals, and provide regular feedback on progress.
- Encourage collaboration: Encourage team members to collaborate on
  projects and share their knowledge and expertise. This can be done
  by creating opportunities for team members to work together, such as
  brainstorming sessions and project-based learning.
- Celebrate successes: When team members achieve their goals,
  celebrate their accomplishments. This will help to boost morale and
  motivation, and it will also reinforce the value of teamwork.

Creating synergy among IT professionals can be challenging, but it is
worthwhile. Following these tips can make a productive, innovative,
and problem-solving team.

* AntiThesis

** Biology

Human beings just despise any hierarchy uncosciously: in nature they
can't gather in a large group due to lack of abundant and reliable
resources - so it is evolutionary the question of life and death for
each member of a group. In one hand the natural (and efficient) group
should be big enough to defend itself, in another - it can't be big to
provide to each member an ability to obtain the suffice amount of food
from the scarce environment around them. So, millions years of
evolution target our biological species to be in comfort in a small
group with _one and only one leader and foregoer_- most experienced,
strong and competent male. Nowadays this model with minor deviations
is widespread across a plethora of indigenous tribes.

** History

All known evidences testify the average size of group of humans was
10-15 members for 100,000 years BC, and only last 5,000 years its
quantity increased from place to place, not ubiquitously though, only
in towns and cities.


** The Peter Principle

"In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of
incompetence."

This is an amazing book by =Laurence J.Peter= unvailing all subtleties
and premises which occur in any particular cell of any human's crew,
initially built in a hierarchical structure, but incline to chaos and
uncertainty later by its nature.

In other words, if you work in an organization with a top-down
management structure and you are good at your job, you will likely be
promoted until you reach one rung above your level of competence. Dr
Peter called this level your "final placement."

While the book is written in a lighthearted manner, there's more than
a grain of truth in its well-researched analysis of one of the main
flaws in hierarchical structures.

All ailments are result of simple, as pie observation:

People with stronger skills tend to be promoted more quickly and that
people with weaker skills tend to get stuck in their current jobs
after just one or two promotions.

** A Clot for Every Slot

From the uper level, where most chiefs are at their point incopetence,
the most feasible and pertinent candidate for _promotion is the most
defty and experienced employee_. But, in this case, team has lost a
valuable and productive member in exchange of a dim perspective to
obtain a good enough team leader. A good leadership requires an
additional set of inter-personal skills and a huge experience in this
area to be noble, authoritative and competent. In addition there is no
guarantee that a new-assigned advanced executionist is apt enough to
learn these new for him skillset in a sure and fire manner.

And, /at the unconscious level of thinking/: if this employee is
capable to be competent, the probability of his competency after
assinment is high enough to make a menace for the Boss.

Another polar point of view is to make a _promotion for the most
incompetent employee_. In this case the team will lost the value near
a zero, the perspective of his succeeding
