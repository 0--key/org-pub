* \alpha{}bout Me

Experienced Python developer with 4 years in software development,
specializing in building, provisioning, hosting, testing, debugging,
maintenance and extension of web applications. Proficient in Flask
web-framework and Jinja template engine, with a strong background in
Linux, RDBMS, algorithms and problem-solving.

** Mentoring
/2023 \to 2024/

Applying ultra-learning methodology I've being a tutor for my wife on
her path to acquire new profession of software tester.

/2022 \to 2023/

Linux, Emacs & Python mentor

** Self-reflection: Emacs, Org-Mode, Cognitive Biases
/2016 \to 2022/

Looking backward it is become clear to me that most of the time I've
spend at software development was, frankly speaking, the waste of
time: I just spent a lion's share of it by seeking out my own mistakes
and figuring out how to fix them. Reasonably, I switched my focus on to
/productivity and efficiency/ issue in software development.

Studied Emacs extensions which might alleviate a headache: static
syntax analysers...


** Freelance: Python3, PostgreSQL, Flask, Jinja2
/2010 \to 2015/

I've developed web-apps galore: from a hundred of web-spiders to a
couple of long-term full-fledged web-sites development. From composing
technical specification, through minimum viable product elaboration,
its extension, testing, debugging and maintenance.


** CEO&CTO: PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3
/2008 \to 2010/


** Linux Red Hat 4 & Ubuntu 5.10

** Scratches

Developed and launch my first start-up project from E2E: the buisiness
idea was to implement the advanced delivery from local grocery stores
to customers without any motor vehicles. The site was written by me in
a PHP&MySQL bundle with a straight folder separation as a primitive
version control system and WML for rendering data on smartphone
screens. Later I filled the system up with goods, advertised and
launch into production, but, alas, it was a failure: no one had had
any wish to use it.
