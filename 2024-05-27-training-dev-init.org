* Tips and advice 

If you want to pursue a career as a ~training developer~, there are
some tips and advice that can be useful.


Building a portfolio of your training projects and samples is a great
way to showcase your skills for potential employers or
clients. Networking with other training professionals and joining
online communities can help you exchange ideas, insights, and
feedback. Additionally, seeking feedback from learners, clients, or
colleagues can help you improve your training products and
processes. You can also use data and analytics to measure the
effectiveness of your training solutions. Above all, it is important
to keep learning and developing your skills and knowledge as a
~training developer~ by enrolling in online courses, reading books or
blogs, or watching videos or podcasts that cover relevant topics and
trends in the field.

Absolutely true! I would definitely focus on two topics included in
this section of the article: what is the business impact or ROI on the
training you’ve developed, and how are you continuing to grow and
develop your own skillset. We were just having this conversation
yesterday, ensuring there is a way to measure the business impact of
the training that has been developed and delivered, and then
communicating that impact, will ensure you stand out. Always align to
the numbers! The moment you are standing still you risk being left
behind. Continuing to expand your skills and keeping up with training
trends will set you up for success in this field.

In my experience, using a different set of frameworks helped me get a
additional perspectives and enhance the impact of and engagement of
content. -Deeply understanding L&D challenges and context. -Adapting
strategic frameworks like the 7S McKinsey or ADKAR for a thorough
analysis. Though not designed for content development, they can guide
content to align with organizational objectives and ensure impact. For
example, content that supports change could emphasize the benefits of
this change, or add questions to reflect on the change even if the
topic is on how to use a new system. -Opting for visual storyboards or
prototypes over text-based ones to provide a clearer, more
comprehensive view to clients and minimize revisions.
