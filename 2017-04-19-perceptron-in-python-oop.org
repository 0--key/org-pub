* Definition

** What is a perceptron?
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   a computer model or computerized machine devised to represent or
   simulate the ability of the brain to recognize and discriminate.
   #+END_QUOTE

   In an initial form the perceptron is a single-layer neural
   network, which has no any hidden units among input and output.

** What is neuron?

   Nerve Cell: Dendrites receive messages from other neurons. The
   message then moves through the axon to the other end of the neuron,
   then to the tips of the axon and then into the space between
   neurons. From there the message can move to the next neuron.
