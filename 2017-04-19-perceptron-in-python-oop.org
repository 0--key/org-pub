* Definition

** What is a neural network?
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   a computer system modelled on the human /brain/ and nervous system
   #+END_QUOTE

** What is brain?
   With no doubt it is a giant nebula (10^{}14) of nervous cells

   Nerve Cell: Dendrites receive messages from other neurons. The
   message then moves through the axon to the other end of the neuron,
   then to the tips of the axon and then into the space between
   neurons. From there the message can move to the next neuron.

  In an initial form the perceptron is a single-layer neural
  network, which has no any hidden units among input and output.
