* Definition
  Nowadays [[https://github.com/][Git]] is a standard option to host your code and share it
  among collaborators. Seems like the best way to introduce it is to
  show how to:

  - Fork an existing repository /and obtain something useful in your
    own repo/
  - Define the remotes /you need to determine from where you want to
    push repo's updates and where to pull your changes/
  - Implement your changes /Some atomic enhancement like a typo/
  - Accomplish a pull request to the parent repository /Get a chance
    to merge your improvements with the main code/

* Documentation
  The definitive guide how-to do all meta-tasks above are the official
  Git documentation site:

* Fixtures

* Results

* Conclusion
